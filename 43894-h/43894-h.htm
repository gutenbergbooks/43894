<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">Inasmuch</span> as modern art, in the beginning of its career, held commerce
almost exclusively with the spirits of dead men of bygone ages, it had
set itself in opposition to all the great epochs that had gone before. All works
known to the history of art, from the cathedral pictures of Stephan Lochner
down to the works of the followers of Watteau, stand in the closest relationship
with the people and times amid which they have originated. Whoever
studies the works of Dürer knows his home and his family, the Nuremberg
of the sixteenth century, with its narrow lanes and gabled houses; the whole
age is reflected in the engravings of this one artist with a truth and distinctness
which put to shame those of the most laborious historian. Dürer and
his contemporaries in Italy stood in so intimate a relation to reality that in
their religious pictures they even set themselves above historical probability,
and treated the miraculous stories of sacred tradition as if they had been
commonplace incidents of the fifteenth century. Or, to take another instance,
with what a striking realism, in the works of Ostade, Brouwer, and Steen,
has the entire epoch from which these great artists drew strength and nourishment
remained vivid in spirit, sentiment, manners, and costume. Every
man whose name has come down to posterity stood firm and unshaken on
the ground of his own time, resting like a tree with all its roots buried in its
own peculiar soil; a tree whose branches rustled in the breeze of its native
land, while the sun which fell on its blossoms and ripened its fruits was that
of Italy or Germany, of Spain or the Netherlands, of that time; never the
weak reflection of a planet that formerly had shone in other zones.</p>

<p>It was not until the beginning of the nineteenth century that this connection
with the life of the present and the soil at home was lost to the art of painting.
It cannot be supposed that later generations will be able to form a conception
of life in the nineteenth century from pictures produced in this period, or that
these pictures will become approximately such documents as the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries possess in the works of Dürer, Bellini, Rubens, or
Rembrandt. The old masters were the children of their age to the very tips
of their fingers. They were saturated with the significance, the ideals, and
the aims of their time, and they saturated them with their own aims, ideals,
and significance. On the other hand, if any one enters a modern picture
gallery and picks out the paintings produced up to 1850, he will often receive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>2</span>
the impression that they belong to earlier centuries. They are without feeling
for the world around, and seem even to know nothing of it.</p>

<p>Even David, the first of the moderns, has left no work, with the exception
of his &ldquo;Marat,&rdquo; which has been baptized with the blood of the French Revolution.
To express the sentiment of Liberty militant he made use of the figures
of Roman heroes. The political freedom of the people, so recently won,
so fresh in men&rsquo;s minds, he illustrated by examples from Roman history.
At a later time, when the allied forces entered Paris after the defeat of
Napoleon, he made use of the story of Leonidas at Thermopylæ. Only in
portrait painting was any kind of justice done to modern life by the painters
in &ldquo;the grand style.&rdquo; True it is that there lived, at the time, a few &ldquo;little
masters&rdquo; who furtively turned out for the market modest little pictures
of the life around them, paintings of buildings and kitchen interiors. The
poor Alsatian painter <i>Martin Drolling</i>, contemptuously designated a &ldquo;dish
painter&rdquo; by the critics, showed in his kitchen pictures that, in spite of David,
something of the spirit of Chardin and the great Dutchmen was still alive in
French art. But he has given his figures and his pots and pans and vegetables
the pose and hard outline of Classicism. A few of his portraits are better
and more delicate, particularly that of the actor Baptiste, with his fine head,
like that of a diplomatist. At the exhibition of 1889, this picture, with its
positive and firmly delineated
characterisation, made
the appeal of a Holbein of
1802. Another &ldquo;little
master,&rdquo; <i>Granet</i>, painted
picturesque ruins, low halls,
and the vaults of churches;
he studied attentively the
problem of light in inner
chambers, and thereby drew
upon himself the reproach
of David, that &ldquo;his drawing
savoured of colour.&rdquo; In
<i>Leopold Boilly</i> Parisian life&mdash;still
like that of a country
town&mdash;and the arrival of the
mail, the market, and the
busy life of the streets, found
an interpreter,&mdash;<i>bourgeois</i> no
doubt, but true to his age.
In the time of the Revolution
he painted a &ldquo;Triumph of
Marat,&rdquo; the tribune of the
people, who is being carried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>3</span>
on the shoulders of his audience
from the <i>palais de justice</i>
in Paris, after delivering an
inflammatory oration. In
1807, when the exhibition of
David&rsquo;s Coronation picture
had thrown all Paris into
excitement, Boilly conceived
the notion of perpetuating
in a rapid sketch the scene
of the exhibition, with the
picture and the crowd pressing
round it. His speciality,
however, was little portrait
groups of honest <i>bourgeois</i> in
their stiff Sunday finery.
Boilly knew with accuracy
the toilettes of his age, the
gowns of the actresses, and
the way they dressed their
heads; he cared nothing
whatever about æsthetic
dignity of style, but represented
each subject as faithfully
as he could, and as
honestly and sincerely as possible. For that reason he is of great historical
value, but he is not painter enough to lay claim to great artistic interest.
The execution of his pictures is petty and diffidently careful, and his neat,
Philistine painting has a suggestion of china and enamel, without a trace
of the ease and spirit with which the eighteenth century carolled over
such work. The heads of his women are the heads of dolls, and his silk
looks like steel. His forerunners are not the Dutchmen of the good
periods, Terborg and Metsu, but the contemporaries of Van der Werff.
He and Drolling and Granet were rather the last issue of the fine old
Dutch schools, rather descendants of Chardin than pioneers, and amongst
the younger men there was at first no one who ventured to sow afresh
the region which had been devastated by Classicism. Géricault certainly
was incited to his &ldquo;Raft of the Medusa&rdquo; not by Livy or Plutarch, but
by an occurrence of the time which was reported in the newspapers; and he
ventured to set an ordinary shipwreck in the place of the Deluge or a naval
battle, and a crew of unknown mortals in the place of Greek heroes. But then
his picture stands alone amongst the works of the Romanticists, and is too
decidedly transposed into a classical key to count as a representation of
modern life.</p>

<p>In its striving after movement and colour, Romanticism put forward the
picturesque and passionate Middle Ages in opposition to the stiff and frigid
neo-Greek or neo-Roman ideal; but it joined with Classicism in despising the
life of the present. Even the political excitement at the close of the Restoration
and the Revolution of July had but little influence on the leading spirits
of the time. Accustomed to look for the elements of pictorial invention in
religious myths, in the fictions of poets, or in the events of older history, they
paid no attention to the mighty social drama enacted so near to them. The
fiery spirit of Delacroix certainly led him to paint his picture of the barricades,
but he drew his inspiration from a poet, from an ode of Auguste Barbier, and
he gave the whole an air of romance and allegory by introducing the figure of
Liberty. He lived in a world of glowing passions, amid which all the struggles
of his age seemed to have for him only a petty material interest. For that
reason he has neither directly nor indirectly drawn on what he saw around him.
He painted the soul, but not the life of his epoch. He was attracted by Teutonic
poets and by the Middle Ages. He set art free from Greek subject-matter and
Italian form, to borrow his ideas from Englishmen and Germans and his colour
from the Flemish school. He is inscrutably silent about French society in the
nineteenth century.</p>

<p>And this alienation from the living world is even more noticeable in Ingres.
His &ldquo;Mass of Pius VII in the Sistine Chapel&rdquo; is the only one of his many
works which deals with a subject of contemporary life, and it was blamed by
the critics because it deviated so far from the great style. As an historical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>6</span>
painter, and when better employed as a painter of portraits, Ingres has crystallised
all the life and marrow of the past in his icy works, and he appears in the
midst of the century like a marvellous and sterile sphinx. Nothing can be
learnt from him concerning the needs and passions and interests of living men.
His own century might writhe and suffer and struggle and bring forth new
thoughts, but he knew nothing about them, or if he did he never allowed
it to be seen.</p>

<p>Delaroche approached somewhat nearer to the present, for he advanced
from antiquity and the Middle Ages to the seventeenth century; and the
historical picture, invented by him, virtually dominated French art under
Napoleon III, in union with the dying Classicism. Even then there was no
painter who yet ventured to portray the manners and types of his age with
the fresh insight and merciless observation of Balzac. All those scenes from
the life of great cities, their fashion and their misery, which then began to
form the substance of drama and romance, had as yet no counterpart in
painting.</p>

<p>The Belgians preserved the same silence. During the whole maturity of
Classicism, from 1800 to 1830, François, Paelinck, van Hanselaere, Odevaere,
de Roi, Duvivier, etc., with their coloured Greek statues, ruled the realm of
figure painting as unmitigated dictators; and amongst the historical painters
who followed them, Wappers, in his &ldquo;Episode,&rdquo; was the only one who drew
on modern life for a subject. There was a desire to revive Rubens. Decaisne,
Wappers, de Keyzer, Bièfve, and Gallait lit their candle at his sun, and were
hailed as the holy band who were to
lead Belgian art to a glorious victory.
But their original national tendency
deviated from real life instead of
leading towards it. For the sake of
painting cuirasses and helmets they
dragged the most obscure national
heroes to the light of day, just as the
Classicists had done with Greeks and
Romans. German painting wandered
through the past with even less
method, taking its material, not from
native, but from French, English,
and Flemish history. From Carstens
down to Makart, German painters of
influence carefully shut their eyes to
reality, and drew down the blinds so
as to see nothing of the life that
surged below them in the street, with
its filth and splendour, its laughter
and misery, its baseness and noble humanity. And from an historical point
of view this alienation from the world is susceptible of an easy explanation.</p>

<p>In France, as in all other countries, the end of the <i>ancien régime</i>, the tempest
of the Revolution, and the consequent modification of the whole of life&mdash;of
sentiments, habits, and ideas, of dress and social conditions&mdash;at first implied
such a sudden change in the horizon that artists were necessarily thrown
into confusion. When the monarchy
entered laughingly upon its struggle
of life and death, the survivors from
the time of Louis <span class="sc">XVI</span>, charming
&ldquo;little masters&rdquo; who had been great
masters in that careless and graceful
epoch, were suddenly made witnesses
of a revolution more abrupt than the
world had yet seen. Savage mobs
forced their way into gardens, palaces,
and reception-rooms, pike in hand,
and with the red cap upon their heads.
The walls echoed with their rude
speech, and plebeian orators played
the part of oracles of freedom and
brotherhood like old Roman tribunes
of the people. What was there
yesterday was no longer to be seen;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>12</span>
a thick powder-smoke hung between
the past and the present. And the
present itself had not yet assumed
determinate shape; it hovered, as yet
unready, between the old and the new
forms of civilization. The storms of
the Revolution put an end to the
comfortable security of private life.
Thus it was that the ready-made and
more easily intelligible shapes and
figures of a world long buried out of
sight, with which men believed themselves
to have an elective affinity,
at first seemed to the artists to
have an infinitely greater value than
the new forms which were in the
throes of birth. Painters became
Classicists because they had not yet
the courage to venture on the
ground where the century itself
was going through a process of fermentation.</p>

<p>The Romanticists despised it, for they thought the fermenting must had
yielded flat lemonade instead of fiery wine. The artist must live in art before
he can produce art. And the more the life of nations has been beautiful, rich,
and splendid, the more nourishment and material has art been able to derive
from it. But when they came the
Romanticists found&mdash;in France as
in Germany&mdash;everything, except a
piece of reality which they could
deem worthy of being painted.
The whole of existence seemed to
this generation so poor and bald, the
costume so inartistic and so like a
caricature, the situation so hopeless
and petty, that they were unable
to tolerate the portrayal of themselves
either in poetry or art. It
was the time of that wistfully sought
phantom which, as they believed,
was to be found only in the past.
The powerful passions of the Middle
Ages were set in opposition to a
flaccid period that was barren of
action.</p>

<p>And then came the overwhelming pressure of the old masters. After the
forlorn condition of colouring brought about by David and Carstens, it was
so vitally necessary to restore the artistic tradition and technique of the old
masters, that it was at first thought necessary to adopt the old subject-matter
also&mdash;especially the splendid robes of the city of the lagoons&mdash;in order to test
the newly acquired secrets of the palette. Faltering unsteadily under influences
derived from the old artists, modern painting did not yet feel itself able to create
finished works of art out of the novel elements which the century placed at
its disposal. It still needed to be carried in the arms of a Venetian or Flemish
nurse.</p>

<p>And æsthetic criticism bestowed its blessing on these attempts. The
Romanticists had been forced to the treatment of history and the deification
of the past by disgust with the grey and colourless present; the younger
generation were long afterwards held captive in this province by æsthetic
views of the dignity of history. To paint one&rsquo;s own age was reckoned a
crime. One had to paint the age of other people. For this purpose the
<i>prix de Rome</i> was instituted. The spirit which produced the pictures of
Cabanel and Bouguereau was the same that induced David to write to Gros,
that the battles of the empire might afford the material for occasional pictures
done under the inspiration of chance, but not for great and earnest works of
art worthy of an historical painter. That æsthetic criticism which taught
that, whatever the subject be, and whatever personages may be represented,
if they belong to the present time the picture is merely a <i>genre</i> picture, still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>14</span>
held the field. Whilst the world was laughing and crying, the painter, with
the colossal power of doing everything, amused himself by trying not to
appear the child of his own time. No one perceived the refinement and
grace, the corruption and wantonness, of modern life as it is in great cities.
No one laid hold on the mighty social problems which the growing century
threw out with a seething creative force. Whoever wishes to know how the
men of the time lived and moved, what hopes and sorrows they bore in their
breasts, whoever seeks for works in which the heart-beat of the century is
alive and throbbing, must have his attention directed to the works of the
draughtsmen, to the illustrations of certain periodicals. It was in the nineteenth
century as in the Middle Ages. As then, when painting was still an
ecclesiastical art, the slowly awakening feeling for nature, the joy of life
was first expressed in miniatures, woodcuts, and engravings, so also the great
draughtsmen of the nineteenth century were the first who set themselves with
their whole strength to bring modern life and all that it contained earnestly
and sincerely within the range of art, the first who held up the glass to their
own time and gave the abridged chronicle of their age. Their calling as
caricaturists led them to direct observation of the world, and lent them the
aptitude of rendering their impressions with ease; and that at a time when
the academical methods of depicting physiognomy obtained elsewhere in
every direction. It necessitated their representing subjects to which, in
accordance with the æsthetic views of the period, they would not otherwise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>15</span>
have addressed themselves; it led them to discover beauties in spheres of
life by which they would otherwise have been repelled. London, the capital
of a free people ruling in all quarters of the globe, the home of millions, where
intricate old corners and back streets left more space than in other cities
for old-fashioned &ldquo;characters,&rdquo; for odd, eccentric creatures and better-class
charlatans of every description, afforded a ground peculiarly favourable for
caricature. In this province, therefore, England holds the first place beyond
dispute.</p>

<p>Direct from Hogarth come the group of political caricaturists, in whom
the sour, bilious temper of John Bull lives on in a new and improved edition.
Men like <i>James Gillray</i> were a power in the political warfare of their time;
bold liberals who fought for the cause of freedom with a divine rage and
slashing irony, while at the same time they were masterly draughtsmen in
a vehement and forceful style. The worst of it is, that the interest excited
by political caricature is always of a very ephemeral nature. The antagonism
of Pitt and Fox, Shelburne and Burke, the avarice and stupidity of
George III, the Union, the conjugal troubles of the Prince of Wales, and the
war with France, seem very uninteresting matters in these days. On the
other hand, <i>Rowlandson</i>, who was not purely a politician, appeals to us in an
intelligible language even after a hundred years have gone by.</p>

<p>Like Hogarth, he was the antithesis of a humorist. Something bitter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>16</span>
and gloomily pessimistic runs through all he touches. He is brutal, with
an inborn power and an indecorous coarseness. His laughter is loud and
his cursing barbarous. Ear-piercing notes escape from the widely opened
lips of his singers, and the tears come thickly from the eyes of his sentimental
old ladies who are hanging on the declamation of a tragic actress. His
comedy is produced by the simplest means. As a rule any sort of contrast
is enough: fat and thin, big and little, young wife and old husband, young
husband and old wife, shying horse and helpless rider on a Sunday out. Or
else he brings the physical and moral qualities of his figures into an absurd
contrast with their age, calling, or behaviour: musicians are deaf, dancing
masters bandy-legged, servants wear the dresscoats and orders of lords,
hideous old maids demean themselves like coquettes, parsons get drunk,
and grave dignitaries of state dance the cancan. And so, when the servant
gets a thrashing, and the coquette a refusal, and the diplomatist loses his
orders by getting a fall, it is their punishment for having forgotten their
proper place. They are all of them &ldquo;careers on slippery ground,&rdquo; with the
same punishments as Hogarth delighted to depict. But Rowlandson became
another man when he set himself to represent the life of the people.</p>

<p>Born in July 1756, in a narrow alley of old London, he grew up amidst
the people. As a young man he saw Paris, Germany, and the Low Countries.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>17</span>
He went regularly to all clubs where there was high play. As man, painter,
and draughtsman alike, he stood in the midst of life. Street scenes in Paris
and London engage his pencil, especially scenes from Vauxhall Gardens, the
meeting-place of fashionable London, and there is often a touch of Menzel
in the palpitating life of these pictures&mdash;in these lords and ladies, fops and
ballad-singers, who pass through the grounds of the gardens in a billowy
stream. His illustrations include everything: soldiers, navvies, life at
home and in the tavern, in town and in village, on the stage and behind the
scenes, at masquerades and in Parliament. When he died at seventy, on
22nd April 1827, the obituaries were able to say of him with truth that he
had drawn all England in the years between 1774 and 1809. And all these
leaves torn from the life of sailors and peasants, these fairs and markets,
beggars, huntsmen, smiths, artizans, and day labourers, were not caricatures,
but sketches keenly observed and sharply executed from life. His countrymen
have at times a magnificent Michelangelesque stir of life which almost
suggests Millet. He was fond of staying at fashionable watering-places,
and came back with charming scenes from high life. But his peculiar field
of observation was the poor quarter of London. Here are the artizans, the
living machines. Endurance, persistence, and resignation may be read in
their long, dismal, angular faces. Here are the women of the people, wasted
and hectic. Their eyes are set deep in their sockets, their noses sharp and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>18</span>
their skin blotched with red spots. They have suffered much and had many
children; they have a sodden, depressed, stoically callous appearance; they
have borne much, and can bear still more. And then the devastations of
gin! that long train of wretched women who of an evening prostitute themselves
in the Strand to pay for their lodging! those terrible streets of London,
where pallid children beg, and tattered spectres, either sullen or drunken,
rove from public-house to public-house, with torn linen and rags hanging about
them in shreds! The cry of misery rising from the pavement of great cities
was first heard by Rowlandson, and the pages on which he drew the poor
of London are a living dance of death of the most ghastly veracity.</p>

<p>But, curiously enough, this same man, who as an observer could be so
uncompromisingly sombre, and so rough and brutal as a caricaturist, had
also a wonderfully delicate feeling for feminine charm. In the pages he has
devoted to the German waltz there lives again the chivalrous elegance of the
period of Werther, and that peculiarly English grace which is so fascinating
in Gainsborough. His young girls are graceful and wholesome in their round
straw hats with broad ribbons; his pretty little wives in their white aprons
and coquettish caps recall Chardin. One feels that he has seen Paris and
appreciated the fine fragrance of Watteau&rsquo;s pictures.</p>

<p>Mention should also be made of <i>Henry William Bunbury</i>, who excelled
in the drawing of horses and ponies. &ldquo;A long Story&rdquo; is an excellent example
of his powers as a caricaturist pure and simple. The variations rung on
the theme of boredom and the self-centred and animated stupidity of the
narrator have been vividly observed, and are earnestly rendered. Rowlandson
has the savage indignation
of Swift; Bunbury is not savage,
but he has the same English seriousness
and something of the same
brutality. The faces here are crapulous
and distorted, and the subject
is treated without lightness or good-nature.
Perhaps the English do
not take their pleasures so very
seriously, but undoubtedly they jest
in earnest. Yet Bunbury&rsquo;s incisiveness
and his thorough command of
what it is his design to express
assure him a distinct position as
an artist. His &ldquo;Richmond Hill&rdquo;
shows the pleasanter side of English
character. The breeze billowing in
the trees, the little lady riding by
on her cob, the buxom dames in
the shay, and the man spinning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>19</span>
past on his curricle, give the scene a spirit of life and movement, besides
rendering it an historical document of the period of social history that
lies between <i>The Virginians</i> and <i>Vanity Fair</i>.</p>

<p>As a political caricaturist <i>George Cruikshank</i> has the same significance
for England as Henri Monnier has for France, and the drawings of the latter
often go straight back to the great English artist. But his first works in 1815
were children&rsquo;s books, and such simple delineations from the world of childhood
and the life of society have done more to preserve his name than political
caricatures. Their touch of satire is only very slight. Cruikshank&rsquo;s ladies
panting under heavy chignons, his serious and exceedingly prosy dames
pouring out tea for serious and not less ceremonious gentlemen, whilst the
girls are galloping round Hyde Park on their thoroughbreds, accompanied
by a brilliant escort of fashionable young men&mdash;they are all of them not so
much caricatures as pictures freshly caught from life. He had a great sense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>20</span>
for toilettes, balls, and parties. And he could draw with artistic observation
and tender feeling the babbling lips and shining eyes of children, the shy
confidence of the little ones, their timid curiosity and their bashful advances.
And thus he opened up the way along which his disciples advanced with so
much success.</p>

<p>The style of illustration has adapted itself to the altered character of
English life. What at first constituted the originality of English caricaturists
was their mordant satire. Everything was painted in exceedingly vivid
colours. Whatever was calculated to bring out an idea in comic or brutal
relief&mdash;great heads and little bodies, an absurd similarity between persons
and animals, the afflorescence of costume&mdash;was seized upon eagerly. These
artists fought for the weary and heavy-laden, and mercilessly lashed the
cut-throats and charlatans. They delighted in spontaneous obscenity,
exuberant vigour, and undisguised coarseness. Men were shaken by a broad
Aristophanic laughter till they seemed like epileptics. At the time when the
Empire style came into England, Gillray could dare to represent by speaking
likenesses some of the best-known London beauties, in a toilette which the
well developed Madame Tallien could not have worn with more assurance.
Such things were no longer possible when England grew out of her awkward
age. After the time of Gillray a complete change came over the spirit of
English caricature. Everything brutal or bitterly personal was abandoned.
The clown put on his dress-clothes, and John Bull became a gentleman. Even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>21</span>
by Cruikshank&rsquo;s time caricature had become serious and well-bred. And his
disciples were indeed not caricaturists at all, but addressed themselves
solely to a delicately poetic representation of subjects. They know neither
Rowlandson&rsquo;s innate force and bitter laughter, nor the gallows humour and
savagery of Hogarth; they are amiable and tenderly grave observers, and
their drawings are not caricatures, but charming pictures of manners.</p>

<p><i>Punch</i>, which was founded in 1841, has perhaps caught the social and
political physiognomy of England in the middle of the nineteenth century
with the greatest delicacy. It is a household paper, a periodical read by
the youngest girls. All the piquant things with which the Parisian papers
are filled are therefore absolutely excluded. It scrupulously ignores the
style of thing to which the <i>Journal Amusant</i> owes three-fourths of its matter.
Every number contains one big political caricature, but otherwise it moves
almost entirely in the region of domestic life. Students flirting with pretty
barmaids, neat little dressmakers carrying heavy bonnet-boxes and pursued
by old gentlemen&mdash;even these are scenes which go a little too far for the
refined tone of the paper which has been adapted to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Next to Cruikshank, the Nestor of caricature, must be mentioned <i>John
Leech</i>, who between 1841 and 1864 was the leading artist on <i>Punch</i>. In his
drawings there is already to be found the high-bred and fragrant delicacy of the
English painting of the present time. They stand in relation to the whimsical
and vigorous works of Rowlandson as the fine <i>esprit</i> of a rococo abbé to the
coarse and healthy wit of Rabelais. The mildness of his own temperament is
reflected in his sketches. Others have been the cause of more laughter, but he
loved beauty and purity. Men are
not often drawn by him, or if he
draws them they are always &ldquo;pretty
fellows,&rdquo; born gentlemen. His
young women are not coquettish
and <i>chic</i>, but simple, natural, and
comely. The old English brutality
and coarseness have become
amiable, subtle, refined, mild, and
seductive in John Leech. He is a
fine and delicate spirit, who seems
very ethereal beside Hogarth and
Rowlandson, those giants fed on
roast-beef; he prefers to occupy
himself with sport and boating, the
season and its fashions, and is at
home in public gardens, at balls,
and at the theatre. Here a pretty
baby is being taken for an airing
in Hyde Park by a tidy little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>22</span>
nurse-maid, and there on mamma&rsquo;s arm goes a charming schoolgirl, who
is being enthusiastically greeted by good-looking boys; here again a young
wife is sitting by the fireside with a novel in her hand and her feet out
of her slippers, while she looks dreamily at the glimmering flame. Or a
girl is standing on the shore in a large straw hat, with her hand shading
her eyes and the wind fluttering her dress. Even his &ldquo;Children of the
Mobility&rdquo; are little angels of grace and purity, in spite of their rags.
The background, be it room, street, or landscape, is merely given with a few
strokes, but it is of more than common charm. Every plate of Leech has a
certain fragrance and lightness of touch and a delicacy of line which has
since been attained only by Frederick Walker. His simplicity of stroke
recalls the old Venetian woodcuts. There is not an unnecessary touch.
Everything is in keeping, everything has a significance.</p>

<p>Leech&rsquo;s successor, <i>George du Maurier</i>, is less delicate&mdash;that is to say, not
so entirely and loftily æsthetic. He is less exclusively poetic, but lives more
in actual life, and suffers less from the raw breath of reality. At the same
time, his drawing is pithier and more incisive; one discerns his French training.
In 1857 du Maurier was a pupil of Gleyre, and returned straight to England
when Leech&rsquo;s place on <i>Punch</i> became vacant by his death. Since that time
du Maurier has been the head of the English school of drawing&mdash;of the diarists
of that society which is displayed in Hyde Park during the season, and found
in London theatres and dining-rooms, and in well-kept English pleasure
grounds, at garden parties and tennis meetings, the leaders of clubs and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>23</span>
drawing-rooms. His snobs rival those of Thackeray, but he has also a special
preference for the fair sex&mdash;for charming women and girls who race about
the lawn at tennis in large hats and bright dresses, or sit by the fire in fashionable
apartments, or hover through a ball-room waltzing in their airy skirts
of tulle. The coquettishness of his little ones is entirely charming, and so
too is the superior and comical exclusiveness of his æsthetically brought-up
children, who will associate with no children not æsthetic.</p>

<p>But the works of <i>Charles Keene</i> are the most English of all. Here the
English reveal that complete singularity which distinguishes them from all
other mortals. Both as a draughtsman and as a humorist Keene stands
with the greatest of the century, on the same level as Daumier and Hokusai.
An old bachelor, an original, a provincial living in the vast city, nothing
pleased him better than to mix with the humbler class, to mount on the
omnibus seat beside the driver, to visit a costermonger, or sit in a dingy
suburban tavern. He led a Bohemian life, and was, nevertheless, a highly
respectable, economical, and careful man. Trips into the country and little
suppers with his friends constituted his greatest pleasures. He was a member
of several glee clubs, and when he sat at home played the Scotch bagpipes,
to the horror of all his neighbours. During his last years his only company
was an old dog, to which he, like poor Tassaert, clung with a touching tenderness.
All the less did he care about &ldquo;the world.&rdquo; Grace and beauty are
not to be sought in his drawings. For him &ldquo;Society&rdquo; did not exist. As
du Maurier is the chronicler of drawing-rooms, Keene was the fine and unsurpassed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>24</span>
observer of the people and of humble London life, and he extended
towards them a friendly optimism and a brotherly sympathy. An endless
succession of the most various, the truest, and the most animated types is
contained in his work: mighty guardsmen swagger, cane in hand, burly and
solemn; cabmen and omnibus drivers, respectable middle-class citizens,
servants, hairdressers, the City police, waiters, muscular Highlanders, corpulent
self-made City men, the seething discontent of Whitechapel; and here and
there amidst them all incomparable old tradesmen&rsquo;s wives, and big, raw-boned
village landladies in the Highlands. Keene has something so natural
and self-evident in his whole manner of expression, that no one is conscious
of the art implied by such drawing. Amongst those living in his time only
Menzel could touch him as a draughtsman, and it was not through chance
that each, in spite of their differences of temperament, greatly admired the
other. Keene bought every drawing of Menzel&rsquo;s that he could get, and
Menzel at his death possessed a large collection of Keene&rsquo;s sketches.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the century Germany had no draughtsmen comparable
for realistic impressiveness with Rowlandson. At a time when the great art
lay so completely bound in the shackles of the Classic school, drawing, too,
appeared only in traditional forms. The artist ventured to draw as he liked
just as little as he ventured to paint anything at all as he saw it; for both
there were rules and strait-waistcoats. Almost everything that was produced
in those years looks weak and flat to-day, forced in composition and
amateurish in drawing. Where
Rowlandson with his brusque
powerful strokes recalls Michael
Angelo or Rembrandt, the Germans
have something laboured, diffident,
and washed out. Yet even here a
couple of unpretentious etchers rise
as welcome and surprising figures
out of the tedious waste of academic
production, though they were little
honoured by their contemporaries.
In their homely sketches, however,
they have remained more classic
than those who put on the classical
garment as if for eternity. What
the painter refused to paint, and
the patrons of art who sought after
ideas would not allow to count
as a picture, because the subject
seemed to them too poor, and the
form too commonplace and undignified&mdash;military
scenes at home
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>25</span>
and abroad, typical and soldierly figures from the great time of the war of
Liberation, the life of the people, the events of the day&mdash;was what the Nuremberg
friends, <i>Johann Adam Klein</i> and <i>Johann Christoph Erhard</i>, diligently
engraved upon copper with sympathetic care, and so left posterity a picture
of German life in the beginning of the century that seems the more sincere
and earnest because it has paid toll neither to style in composition nor to
idealism. This invaluable Klein was a healthy and sincere realist, from whom
the æsthetic theories of the time recoiled without effect, and he had no other
motive than to render faithfully whatever he saw. Even in Vienna, whither
he came as a young man in 1811, it was not the picture galleries which roused
him to his first studies, but the picturesque national costumes of the Wallachians,
Poles, and Hungarians, and their horses and peculiar vehicles. A sojourn
among the country manors of Styria gave him opportunity for making a
number of pretty sketches of rural life. In the warlike years 1813 and 1814,
with their marching and their bivouacs, he went about all day long drawing
amongst the soldiers. Even in Rome it was not the statues that fascinated
him, but the bright street scenes, the ecclesiastical solemnities, and the
picturesque caravans of country people. And when he settled down in
Nuremburg, and afterwards in Munich, he did not cease to be sensitive to all
impressions that forced themselves on him in varying fulness. The basis of
his art was faithful and loving observation of life as it was around him, the
pure joy the genuine artist has in making a picture of everything he sees.</p>

<p>Poor Erhard, who at twenty-six ended his life by suicide, was a yet more
delicate and sensitive nature. The marching of Russian troops through
his native town roused him to his first works, and even in these early military
and canteen scenes he shows himself an exceptionally sharp and positive
observer. The costumes, the uniforms, the teams and waggons, are drawn
with decision and accuracy. From Vienna he made walking tours to the
picturesque regions of the Schneeberg, wandered through Salzburg and
Pinzgau, and gazed with wonder at the idyllic loveliness of nature as she is
in these regions, on the cosy rooms of the peasants with their great tiled stoves
and the sun-burnt figures of the country people. He had a heart for nature,
an intimate, poetic, and profound love for what is humble and familiar&mdash;for
homely meadows, trees, and streams, for groves and hedgerows, for quiet
gardens and sequestered spots. He approached everything with observation
as direct as a child&rsquo;s. Both Klein and he endeavoured to grasp a fragment
of nature distinctly, and without any kind of transformation or generalisation;
and this fresh, unvarnished, thoroughly German feeling for nature gives
them, rather than Mengs and Carstens, the right to be counted as ancestors
of the newer German art.</p>

<p>Klein and Erhard having set out in advance, others, such as Haller von
Hallerstein, L. C. Wagner, F. Rechberger, F. Moessmer, K. Wagner, E. A.
Lebschée, and August Geist, each after his own fashion, made little voyages
of discovery into the world of nature
belonging to their own country. But
Erhard, who died in 1822, has found
his greatest disciple in a young Dresden
master, whose name makes the familiar
appeal of an old lullaby which suddenly
strikes the ear amid the bustle of the
world&mdash;in <i>Ludwig Richter</i>, familiar to
all Germans. Richter himself has
designated Chodowiecki, Gessner, and
Erhard as those whose contemplative
love of nature guided him to his own
path. What Leech, that charming
draughtsman of the child-world, was
to the English, Ludwig Richter became
for the Germans. Not that he could
be compared with Leech in artistic
qualities. Beside those of the British
artist his works are like the exercises of
a gifted amateur: they have a petty
correctness and a <i>bourgeois</i> neatness of
line. But Germans are quite willing
to forget the artistic point of view in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>27</span>
relation to their Ludwig Richter. Sunny and childlike as he is, they love him
too much to care to see his artistic failings. Here is really that renowned
German &ldquo;<i>Gemüth</i>&rdquo; of which others make so great an abuse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am certainly living here in a rather circumscribed fashion, but in a very
cheerful situation outside the town, and I am writing you this letter (it is
Sunday afternoon) in a shady arbour, with a long row of rose-bushes in bloom
before me. Now and then they are ruffled by a pleasant breeze&mdash;which is
also the cause of a big blot being on this sheet, as it blew the page over.&rdquo; This
one passage reveals the whole man. Can one think of Ludwig Richter living in
any town except Dresden, or imagine him except in this dressing-gown, seated
on a Sunday afternoon in his shady arbour with the rose-bushes, and surrounded
by laughing children? That profound domestic sentiment which
runs through his works with a biblical fidelity of heart is reflected in the homeliness
of the artist, who has remained all his life a big, unsophisticated child;
and his autobiography, in its patriarchal simplicity, is like a refreshing draught
from a pure mountain spring. Richter survived into the present as an
original type from a time long vanished. What old-world figures did he not see
around him as a boy, when he went about, eager for novelty, with his grandfather,
the copperplate printer, who in his leisure hours studied alchemy and
the art of producing gold, and was surrounded by an innumerable quantity
of clocks, ticking, striking, and making cuckoo notes in his dark workroom;
or as he listened to his blind, garrulous grandmother, around whom the children
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>28</span>
and old wives of the neighbourhood
used to gather to hear her
tales. That was in 1810, and
two generations later, as an old
man surrounded by his grandsons,
he found once more the old,
merry child life of his own home.
And it was once more a fragment
of the good old times, when on
Christmas Eve the little band
came shouting round the house
of gingerbread from <i>Hansel and
Gretel</i> which grandfather had
built out of real gingerbread
after his own drawing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If my art never entered
amongst the lilies and roses on
the summit of Parnassus, it
bloomed by the roads and banks,
on the hedges and in the meadows,
and travellers resting by
the wayside were glad of it, and
little children made wreaths and
crowns of it, and the solitary lover of nature rejoiced in its colour and
fragrance, which mounted like a prayer to Heaven.&rdquo; Richter had the right
to inscribe these words in his diary on his eightieth birthday.</p>

<p>Through his works there echoes a humming and chiming like the joyous cry
of children and the twitter of birds. Even his landscapes are filled with that
blissful and solemn feeling that Sunday and the spring produce together in a
lonely walk over field and meadow. The &ldquo;<i>Gemüthlichkeit</i>,&rdquo; the cordiality, of
German family-life, with a trait of contemplative romance, could find such a
charming interpreter in none but him, the old man who went about in his long
loose coat and had the face of an ordinary village schoolmaster. Only he who
retained to his old age that childlike heart&mdash;to which the kingdom of heaven
is given even in art&mdash;could really know the heart of the child&rsquo;s world, which
even at a later date in Germany was not drawn more simply or more graciously.</p>

<p>His illustrations present an almost exhaustive picture of the life of the
German people at home and in the world, at work and in their pleasure, in
suffering and in joy. He follows it through all grades and all seasons of the
year. Everything is true and genuine, everything seized from life in its
fulness: the child splashing in a tub; the lad shouting as he catches the first
snowflake in his hat; the lovers seated whispering in their cosy little chamber,
or wandering arm in arm on their &ldquo;homeward way through the corn&rdquo; amid
the evening landscape touched with gold; the girl at her spinning-wheel and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>29</span>
the hunter in the forest, the travelling journeyman, the beggar, the well-to-do
Philistine. The scene is the sitting-room or the nursery, the porch twined with
vine, the street with old-fashioned overhanging storeys and turrets, the forest
and the field with splendid glimpses into the hazy distance. Children are
playing round a great tree, labourers are coming back from the field, or the
family is taking its rest in some hour of relaxation. A peaceful quietude and
chaste purity spread over everything. Certainly Richter&rsquo;s drawing has
something pedantic and unemphatic, that weak, generalising roundness which,
beside the sharp, powerful stroke of the old artists, has the spirit of a drawing-master.
But what he has to give is always influenced by delicate and loving
observation, and never stands in contradiction to truth. He does not give the
whole of nature, but neither does he give what is unnatural. He is one of the
first of Germans whose art did not spring from a negation of reality, produced
by treating it on an arbitrary system, but rested instead upon tender
reverie, transfigured into poetry. When in the fifties he stayed a summer
in pleasant Loschwitz, he wrote in his diary: &ldquo;O God, how magnificent is
the wide country round, from my little place upon the hill! So divinely
beautiful, and so sensuously beautiful! The deep blue heaven, the wide green
world, the bright and fair May landscape alive with a thousand voices.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In all that generation, to whom existence seemed so sad, Ludwig Richter
is one of the few who really felt content with the earth, and held the life
around them to be the best
and healthiest material for the
artist. And that is the substance
of the plate to which
he gave the title &ldquo;Rules of
Art.&rdquo; A wide landscape
stretches away with mighty
oaks slanting down, and a
purling spring from which a
young girl is drawing water,
whilst a high-road, enlivened
by travellers young and old,
runs over hill and dale into
the sunny distance. In the
midst of this free rejoicing
world the artist is seated with
his pencil. And above stands
the motto written by Richter&rsquo;s
hand&mdash;</p>

<p class="center f90">
&ldquo;Und die Sonne Homer&rsquo;s, siehe
sie lächelt auch uns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the success of Richter
certain disciples were inspired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>30</span>
to tread the same ground, although
none of them equalled
him in his charming human
qualities. And least of all <i>Oskar
Pletsch</i>, whose self-sufficient smile
is soon recognised in all its
emptiness. Everything which
in Richter was genuine and
original is in him flat, laboured,
and prearranged. His landscapes,
which in part are very
pretty, are derived from R.
Schuster; what seems good in
the children is Richter&rsquo;s property,
and what Pletsch contributed
is the conventionality. <i>Albert
Hendschel</i> also stood on Richter&rsquo;s shoulders, but his popularity is more
justifiable. Even in these days one takes pleasure in his sketch-books, in
which he immortalised the joy and sorrow of youth in such a delicious way.</p>

<p><i>Eugen Neureuther</i> worked in Munich, and as an etcher revelled in the
charming play of arabesques and ornamental borders, and told of pleasant
little scenes from the life of the Bavarian people in his pretty peasant quatrains.</p>

<p>The rise of caricature in Germany
dates from the year 1848. Though
there are extant from the first third of
the century no more than a few topical
papers of no artistic importance, periodical
publications, which soon brought
a large number of vigorous caricaturists
into notice, began to appear from that
time, owing to the political agitations of
the period. <i>Kladderadatsch</i> was brought
out in Berlin, and <i>Fliegende Blätter</i> was
founded in Munich, and side by side
with it <i>Münchener Bilderbogen</i>. But
later generations will be referred <i>par
excellence</i> to <i>Fliegende Blätter</i> for a
picture of German life in the nineteenth
century. What the painters of those
years forgot to transmit is here stored
up: a history of German manners
which could not imaginably be more
exact or more exhaustive. From the
very first day it united on its staff of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>31</span>
collaborators almost all the most important names in their own peculiar
branch. Schwind, Spitzweg, that genial humorist, and many others whom
the German people will not forget, won their spurs here, and were inexhaustible
in pretty theatre scenes, satires on German and Italian singing, memorial
sketches of Fanny Elsler, of the inventor of the dress coat, etc., which enlivened
the whole civilized world at that time. This elder generation of draughtsmen
on <i>Fliegende Blätter</i> were, indeed, not free from the guilt of producing stereotyped
figures. The travelling
Englishman, the Polish Jew,
the counter-jumper, the young
painter, the rich boor, the
stepmother, the housemaid,
and the nervous countess are
everywhere the same in the
first volumes. In caricature,
just as in &ldquo;great art,&rdquo; they
still worked a little in accordance
with rules and conventions.
To observe life with
an objective unprejudiced
glance, and to hold it fast in
all its palpitating movement,
was reserved for men of later
date.</p>

<p>Two of the greatest humorists
of the world in illustrative
art, <i>Wilhelm Busch</i>
and <i>Adolf Oberländer</i>, stand
at the head of those who
ushered in the flourishing
period of German caricature.
They are masters, and take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>32</span>
in with their glance the entire
social world of our time, and in
their brilliant prints they have
made a history of civilisation for
the epoch which will be more
vivid and instructive for posterity
than the most voluminous works
of the greatest historians. Their
heads are known by Lenbach&rsquo;s
pictures. One has an exceptionally
clever, expressive countenance&mdash;a
thorough painter&rsquo;s head.
The humorist may be recognised
by the curious narrowing of one
eye, the well-known eye of the humorist that sees everything, proves everything,
and holds fast every absurdity in the gestures, every
eccentricity in the bearing of his neighbour. That is
Wilhelm Busch.</p>

<p>In the large orbs of the other&mdash;orbs which seem to
grow strangely wide by long gazing as at some fixed
object&mdash;there is no smile of deliberate mischief, and it is
not easy to associate the name of Oberländer with this
Saturnian round face, with its curiously timid glance. One
is reminded of the definition of humour as &ldquo;smiling amid
tears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even in those days when he came every year to Munich
and painted in Lenbach&rsquo;s studio, Busch was a shy and
moody man, who thawed only in the narrowest circle of his
friends: now he has buried himself in a market-town in the
province of Hanover, in Wiedensahl, which, according to
Ritter&rsquo;s <i>Gazetteer</i>, numbers eight hundred and twenty-eight
inhabitants. He lives in the house of his brother-in-law,
the clergyman of the parish, and gives himself up to the
culture of bees. His laughter has fallen silent, and it is
only a journal on bees that now receives contributions from
his hand. But what works this hermit of Wiedensahl produced
in the days when he migrated from Düsseldorf and
Antwerp to Munich, and began in 1859 his series of sketches
for <i>Fliegende Blätter</i>! The first were stiff and clumsy, the
text in prose and not particularly witty. But the earliest
work with a versified text, <i>Der Bauer und der Windmüller</i>,
contains in the germ all the qualities which later found such
brilliant expression in <i>Max und Moritz</i>, in <i>Der Heilige
Antonius</i>, <i>Die Fromme Helene</i>, and <i>Die Erlebnisse Knopps,</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>33</span>
<i>des Junggesellen</i>, and made Busch&rsquo;s works an inexhaustible fountain of mirth
and enjoyment.</p>

<p>Busch unites an uncommonly sharp eye with a marvellously flexible hand.
Wild as his subjects generally are, he solves the greatest difficulties as easily
as though they were child&rsquo;s play. His heroes appear in situations of the most
urgent kind, which place their bodily parts in violent and exceedingly uncomfortable
positions: they thrash others or get thrashed themselves, they
stumble or fall. And in what a masterly way are all these anomalies seized,
the boldest foreshortenings and the most flying movements! Untrained eyes
see only a scrawl, but for those who know how to look, a drawing by Busch
is life itself, freed from all unnecessary detail, and marked down in its great
characteristic lines. And amid all this simplification, what knowledge there
is under the guise of carelessness, and what fine calculation! Busch is at
once simpler and more inventive than the English. With a maze of flourishes
run half-mad, and a few points and blotches, he forms a sparkling picture.
With the fewest possible means he hits the essential point, and for that reason
he is justly called by Grand Cartaret the classic of caricaturists, <i>le roi de la charge
et la bouffonnerie</i>.</p>

<p><i>Oberländer</i>, without whom it would be impossible to imagine <i>Fliegende
Blätter</i>, has not fallen silent. He works on, &ldquo;fresh and splendid as on the
first day.&rdquo; A gifted nature like
Busch, he possesses, at the same
time, that fertility of which
Dürer said: &ldquo;A good painter is
inwardly complete and opulent,
and were it possible for him to
live eternally, then by virtue of
those inward ideas of which Plato
writes he would be always able
to pour something new into his
works.&rdquo; It is now thirty years
ago that he began his labours for
<i>Fliegende Blätter</i>, and since that
time some drawing of his, which
has filled every one with delight,
has appeared almost every week.
Kant said that Providence has
given men three things to console
them amid the miseries of life&mdash;hope,
sleep, and laughter. If he
is right, Oberländer is amongst
the greatest benefactors of mankind.
Every one of his new
sketches maintains the old precious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>34</span>
qualities. It might be said that, by the side of the comedian Busch,
Oberländer seems a serious psychologist. Wilhelm Busch lays his whole
emphasis on the comical effects of simplicity; he knows how to reduce an
object in a masterly fashion to its elemental lines, which are comic in themselves
by their epigrammatic pregnancy. He calls forth peals of laughter
by the farcical spirit of his inventions and the boldness with which he renders
his characters absurd. He is also the author of his own letterpress. His
drawings are unimaginable without the verse, without the finely calculated and
dramatic succession of situations growing to a catastrophe. Oberländer gets
his effect purely by means of the pictorial elements in his representation,
and attains a comical result, neither by the distorted exaggeration of what is
on the face of the matter ridiculous, nor by an elementary simplification,
but by a refined sharpening of character. It seems uncanny that a man should
have such eyes in his head; there is something almost visionary in the way
he picks out of everything the determining feature of its being. And whilst
he faintly exaggerates what is characteristic and renders it distinct, his picture
is given a force and power of conviction to which no previous caricaturist has
attained, with so much discretion at the same time. No one has attained
the drollness of Oberländer&rsquo;s people, animals, and plants. He draws <i>à la</i> Max,
<i>à la</i> Makart, Rethel, Genelli, or Piloty, hunts in the desert or theatrical representations,
Renaissance architecture run mad or the most modern European
mashers. He is as much at home in the Cameroons as in Munich, and in
transferring the droll scenes of human life to the animal world he is a classic.
He sports with hens, herrings, dogs, ducks, ravens, bears, and elephants as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>35</span>
Hokusai does with his frogs. Beside such animals all the Reinecke series of
Wilhelm Kaulbach look like &ldquo;drawings from the copybook of little Moritz.&rdquo;
And landscapes which in their tender intimacy of feeling seem like anticipations
of Cazin sometimes form the background of these creatures. One can scarcely
err in supposing that posterity will place certain plates from the work of this
quiet, amiable man beside the best which the history of drawing has anywhere
to show.</p>

<p>Debucourt and Carle Vernet, the pair who made their appearance immediately
after the storms of the Revolution, are alike able and charming
artists, who depict the pleasures of the salon in a graceful style; and they
rival the great satirists on the other side of the Channel in the incisiveness
of their drawing, and frequently
even surpass them by the added
charm of colour.</p>

<p><i>Carle Vernet</i>, originally an historical
painter, remembered that
he had married the daughter
of the younger Moreau, and set
himself to portray the doings of
the <i>jeunesse dorée</i> of the end
of the eighteenth century in his
<i>incroyables</i> and his <i>merveilleuses</i>.
Crazy, eccentric, and superstitious,
he divided his time afterwards
between women and his
club-fellows, horses and dogs.
He survives in the history of art
as the chronicler of sport, hunting,
racing, and drawing-room
and café scenes.</p>

<p><i>Louis Philibert Debucourt</i> was
a pupil of Vien, and had painted
<i>genre</i> pictures in the spirit of
Greuze before he turned in 1785
to colour engraving. In this
year appeared the pretty
&ldquo;Menuet de la Mariée,&rdquo; with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>36</span>
the peasant couples dancing, and the dainty châtelaine who laughingly
opens the ball with the young husband. After that he had found his
specialty, and in the last decade of the eighteenth century he produced
the finest of his colour engravings. In 1792 there is the wonderful
promenade in the gallery of the Palais Royal, with its swarming crowd of
young officers, priests, students, shop-girls, and <i>cocottes</i>; in 1797 &ldquo;Grandmother&rsquo;s
Birthday,&rdquo; &ldquo;Friday Forenoon at the Parisian Bourse,&rdquo; and many
others. The effects of technique which he achieved by means of colour
engraving are surprising. A freshness like that of water colour lies on these
yellow straw hats, lightly rouged cheeks, and rosy shoulders. To white silk
cloaks trimmed with fur he gives the iridescence of a robe by Netscher. If
there survived nothing except Debucourt from the whole art of the eighteenth
century, he would alone suffice to give an idea of the entire spirit of the time.
Only one note would be wanting, the familiar simplicity of Chardin. The
smiling grace of Greuze, the elegance of Watteau, and the sensuousness of
Boucher&mdash;he has them all, although they are weakened in him, and precisely
by his affectation is he the true child of his epoch. The crowd which is promenading
beneath the trees of the Palais Royal in 1792 is no longer the same which
fills the drawing-rooms of Versailles and Petit Trianon in the pages of Cochin.
The faces are coarser and more plebeian. Red waistcoats with <i>breloques</i> as
large as fists, and stout canes with great gold tops, make the costume of the
men loud and ostentatious, while eccentric hats, broad sashes, and high coiffures
bedizen the ladies more than is consistent with elegance. At the same time,
Debucourt gives this democracy an aristocratic bearing. His prostitutes
look like duchesses. His art is an attenuated
echo of the <i>rococo</i> period. In
him the <i>décadence</i> is embodied, and all
the grace and elegance of the century is
once more united, although it has become
more <i>bourgeois</i>.</p>

<p>The Empire again was less favourable
to caricature. Not that there was any
want of material, but the censorship
kept a strict watch over the welfare of
France. Besides, the artists who made
their appearance after David lived on
Olympus, and would have nothing to do
with the common things of life. Neither
draughtsmen nor engravers could effect
anything so long as they saw themselves
overlooked by a Greek or Roman phantom
as they bent over their paper or
their plate of copper, and felt it their
duty to suggest the stiff lines of antique
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>37</span>
statues beneath the folds of modern costume.</p>

<p><i>Bosio</i> was the genuine product of this
style. Every one of his pictures has become
tedious, because of a spurious classicism
to which he adhered with inflexible
consistency. He cannot draw a grisette
without seeing her with David&rsquo;s eyes. It
deprives his figures of truth and interest.
Something of the correctness of a schoolmistress
is peculiar to them. His grace is
too classic, his merriment too well-bred,
and everything in them too carefully
arranged to give the idea of scenes
rapidly depicted from life. Beauty of
line is offered in place of spontaneity
of observation, and even the character
of the drawing is lost in a pedantic
elegance which envelopes everything with
the uniformly graceful veil of an insipidly fluent outline.</p>

<p>As soon as Romanticism had broken with the classic system, certain great
draughtsmen, who laid a bold hand on modern life without being shackled by
æsthetic formulæ, came to the front in France. <i>Henri Monnier</i>, the eldest of
them, was born a year after the proclamation of the Empire. Cloaks, plumes,
and sabretasches were the first impressions of his youth; he saw the return of
triumphant armies and heard the fanfare of victorious trumpets. The Old
Guard remained his ideal, the inglorious kingship of the Restoration his abhorrence.
He was a supernumerary clerk in the Department of Justice when in
1828 his first brochure, <i>M&oelig;urs administratives dessinées d&rsquo;aprés nature par
Henri Monnier</i>, disclosed to his superiors that the eyes of this poor young man
in the service of the Ministry had seen more than they should have done.
Dismissed from his post, he was obliged to support himself by his pencil, and
became the chronicler of the epoch. In Monnier&rsquo;s prints breathes the happy
Paris of the good old times, a Paris which in these days scarcely exists even
in the provinces. His &ldquo;Joseph Proudhomme,&rdquo; from his shoe-buckles to his
stand-up collar, from his white cravat to his blue spectacles, is as immortal as
<i>Eisele und Beisele</i>, <i>Schulze und Müller</i>, or Molière&rsquo;s <i>Bourgeois Gentilhomme</i>.
Monnier himself is his own Proudhomme. He is the Philistine in Paris,
enjoying little Parisian idylls with a <i>bourgeois</i> complacency. With him there
is no distinction between beautiful and ugly; he finds that everything in
nature can be turned to account. How admirably the different worlds of
Parisian society are discriminated in his <i>Quartiers de Paris</i>! How finely he has
portrayed the grisette of the period, with her following of young tradesmen
and poor students! As yet she has not blossomed into the fine lady, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>38</span>
luxurious <i>blasée</i> woman of
the next generation. She
is still the bashful <i>modiste</i>
or dressmaker&rsquo;s apprentice
whose outings in the country
are described by Paul de
Kock, a pretty child in a
short skirt who lives in an
attic and dresses up only
when she goes to the theatre
or into the country on a
Sunday. Monnier gives her
an air of good-nature, something
delightfully childlike.
In the society of her adorers
she is content with the
cheapest pleasures, drinks
cider and eats cakes, rides
on a donkey or breakfasts
amid the trees, and hardly
coquets at all when a fat old
gentleman follows her on the boulevards. These innocent flirtations remind
one as little of the more recent <i>lorettes</i> of Gavarni as these in their turn
anticipate the drunken street-walkers of Rops.</p>

<p>Under Louis Philippe began the true modern period of French caricature,
the flourishing time when really great artists devoted themselves to it. It never
raised its head more proudly than under the <i>bourgeois</i> king, whose onion head
always served the relentless Philippon as a target for his wit. It was never
armed in more formidable fashion; it never dealt more terrible blows. Charles
Philippon&rsquo;s famous journal <i>La Caricature</i> was the most powerful lever that the
republicans used against the &ldquo;July government&rdquo;; it was equally feared by the
Ministry, the <i>bourgeoisie</i>, and the throne. When the <i>Charivari</i> followed <i>La
Caricature</i> in 1832, political cartoons began to give way to the simple portraiture
of manners in French life. The powder made for heavy guns exploded in a
facile play of fireworks improvised for the occasion.</p>

<p>French society in the nineteenth century has to thank principally <i>Daumier</i>
and <i>Gavarni</i> for being brought gradually within the sphere of artistic representation.
These men are usually called caricaturists, yet they were in reality the
great historians of their age. Through long years they laboured every week
and almost every day at their great history, which embraced thousands of
chapters&mdash;at a true zoology of the human species; and their work, drawn upon
stone in black and white, proves them not merely genuine historians, but really
eminent artists who merit a place beside the greatest.</p>

<p>When in his young days Daubigny trod the pavement of the Sistine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>39</span>
Chapel in Rome, he is said to have exclaimed in astonishment, &ldquo;That looks
as if it had been done by Daumier!&rdquo; and from that time Daumier was aptly
called the Michael Angelo of caricature. Even when he is laughing there is
a Florentine inspiration of the terrible in his style, a grotesque magnificence,
a might suggestive of Buonarotti. In the period before 1848 he dealt the
constitutional monarchy crushing blows by his drawings. &ldquo;Le Ventre legislatif&rdquo;
marks the furthest point to which political caricature ever ventured
in France. But when he put politics on one side and set himself free from
Philippon, this same man made the most wonderful drawings from life. His
&ldquo;Robert Macaire&rdquo; giving instructions to his clerk as a tradesman, sending his
patients exorbitant bills as doctor to the poor, lording it over the bourse as
banker, taking bribes as juryman, and fleecing a peasant as land-agent, is the
incarnation of the <i>bourgeois</i> monarchy, a splendid criticism on the money-grubbing
century. Politicians, officials, artists, actors, honest citizens, old-clothes-mongers,
newspaper-boys, impecunious painters, the most various and
the basest creatures are treated by his pencil, and appear on pages which are
often terrible in their depth and truthfulness of observation. The period of
Louis Philippe is accurately portrayed in these prints, every one of which belongs
to the great volume of the human tragicomedy. In his &ldquo;Émotions parisiennes&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Bohémiens de Paris&rdquo; he deals with misfortune, hunger, the impudence
of vice, and the horror of misery.
His &ldquo;Histoire ancienne&rdquo; ridiculed
the absurdity of Classicism <i>à la</i> David
at a time when it was still regarded
as high treason to touch this sacred
fane. These modern figures with the
classical pose, which to some extent
parodied David&rsquo;s pictures, were probably
what first brought his contemporaries
to a sense of the stiffness and
falsity of the whole movement; and
at a later period Offenbach also contributed
his best ideas with much the
same result. Moreover, Daumier was
a landscape-painter of the first order.
No one has more successfully rendered
the appearance of bridges and houses,
of quays and streets under a downpour,
of nature enfeebled as it is in
the precincts of Paris. He was an
instantaneous photographer without
a rival, a physiognomist such as
Breughel was in the sixteenth century,
Jan Steen and Brouwer in the seventeenth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>40</span>
and Chodowiecki in the eighteenth, with the difference that his
drawing was as broad and powerful as Chodowiecki&rsquo;s was delicate and
refined. This inborn force of line, suggestive of Jordaens, places his sketches
as high, considered as works of art, as they are invaluable as historical
documents. The treatment is so summary, the outline so simplified, the
pantomime, gesticulation, and pose always so expressive; and Daumier&rsquo;s
influence on several artists is beyond doubt. Millet, the great painter of
peasants, owes much to the draughtsman of the <i>bourgeois</i>. Precisely what
constitutes his &ldquo;style,&rdquo; the great line, the simplification, the intelligent
abstention from anecdotic trifles, are things which he learnt from Daumier.</p>

<p>During the years when he drew for the <i>Charivari</i>, <i>Gavarni</i> was the exact
opposite of Daumier. In the one was a forceful strength, in the other a
refined grace; in the one brusque and savage observation and almost menacing
sarcasm, in the other the wayward mood of the butterfly flitting lightly from
flower to flower. Daumier might be compared with Rabelais; Gavarni, the
<i>spirituel</i> journalist of the <i>grand monde</i> and the <i>demi-monde</i>, the draughtsman
of elegance and of <i>roués</i> and <i>lorettes</i>, might be compared with Molière. Born
of poor parentage in Paris in 1801, and in his youth a mechanician, he supported
himself from the year 1835 by fashion prints and costume drawings.
He undertook the conduct of a fashion journal, <i>Les Gens du Monde</i>, and began
it with a series of drawings from the life of the <i>jeunesse dorée</i>: <i>les Lorettes</i>, <i>les
Actrices</i>, <i>les Fashionables</i>, <i>les Artistes</i>, <i>les Étudiants de Paris</i>, <i>les Bals masqués</i>,
<i>les Souvenirs du Carnaval</i>, <i>la Vie des Jeunes Hommes</i>. A new world was here
revealed with bold traits. The women
of Daumier are good, fat mothers,
always busy, quick-witted, and of an
enviable constitution; women who
are careful in the management of
their household, and who go to
market and take their husband&rsquo;s
place at his office when necessary.
In Gavarni the women are piquant
and given to pouting, draped in silk
and enveloped in soft velvet mantles.
They are fond of dining in the <i>cabinet
particulier</i>, and of scratching the
name of their lover, for the time
being, upon crystal mirrors.</p>

<p>Gavarni was the first who seized
the worldly side of modern life; he
portrayed elegant figures full of <i>chic</i>,
and gave them a garb which fitted
them exactly. In his own dress he
had a taste for what was dandified,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>41</span>
and he plunged gaily into the enjoyment of the Parisian life which eddied
around in a whirl of pleasure. The present generation feels that the air
in such old journals of fashion is heavy. In every work of art there is,
in addition to what endures, a fine perfume that evaporates after a certain
number of years, and is no longer perceptible to those who come afterwards.
What is fresh and modern to-day looks to-morrow like the dried flowers
which the botanist keeps in a herbarium. And those who draw the
fashions of their age are specially liable to this swift decay. Thus many
of Gavarni&rsquo;s lithographs have the effect of pallid pictures of a vanished
world. But the generation of 1830 honoured in him the same <i>charmeur</i>,
the same master of enamoured grace, which that of 1730 had done in
Watteau. He was sought after as an inventor of fashions, whom the tailor
Humann, the Worth of the &ldquo;July Monarchy,&rdquo; regarded as his rival. He was
the discoverer of all the fairy costumes which formed the chief attraction at
masquerades and theatres, the delicate <i>gourmet</i> of the eternal feminine; and
having dangled much after women, he knew how to render the wave of a
petticoat, the seductive charm of a well-proportioned leg, and the coquettishness
of a new <i>coiffure</i> with the most familiar connoisseurship. He has been
called the Balzac of draughtsmen. And the sentences at the bottom of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>42</span>
sketches, for which he is also
responsible, are as audacious
as the pictures themselves.
Thus, when the young exquisite
in the series &ldquo;La Vie des
Jeunes Hommes&rdquo; stands with
his companion before a skeleton
in the anthropological
museum, the little woman
opines with a shudder, &ldquo;When
one thinks that this is a man,
and that women love <i>that</i>&rdquo;!</p>

<p>But that is only one side
of the sphinx. He is only
half known when one thinks
only of the draughtsman of
ladies&rsquo; fashions who celebrated
the free and easy graces of the
<i>demi-monde</i> and the wild
licence of the carnival. At
bottom Gavarni was not a
frivolous butterfly, but an
artist of a strangely sombre
imagination, a profound and
melancholy philosopher who had a prescience of all the mysteries of life. All
the mighty problems which the century produced danced before his spirit like
spectral notes of interrogation.</p>

<p>The transition was made when, as an older man, he depicted the cold,
sober wakening that follows the wild night. <i>Constantin Guys</i> had already
worked on these lines. He was an unfortunate and ailing man, who passed
his existence, like Verlaine, in hospital, and died in an almshouse. Guys
has not left much behind him, but in that little he shows himself the true
forerunner of the moderns, and it is not a mere chance that Baudelaire, the
ancestor of the <i>décadence</i>, established Guys&rsquo; memory. These women who
wander aimlessly about the streets with weary movements and heavy eyes
deadened with absinthe, and who flit through the ball-room like bats, have
nothing of the innocent charm of Monnier&rsquo;s grisettes. They are the uncanny
harbingers of death, the demoniacal brides of Satan. Guys exercised on
Gavarni an influence which brought into being his <i>Invalides du sentiment</i>,
his <i>Lorettes vieilles</i>, and his <i>Fourberies de femmes</i>. &ldquo;The pleasure of all
creatures is mingled with bitterness.&rdquo; The frivolous worldling became a misanthrope
from whom no secret of the foul city was hidden; a pessimist who
had begun to recognise the human brute, the swamp-flower of over-civilisation,
the &ldquo;bitter fruit which is inwardly full of ashes,&rdquo; in the queen of the drawing-room
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>43</span>
as in the prostitute of the gutter. Henceforth he only recognises a love
whose pleasures are to be reckoned amongst the horrors of death. His works
could be shown to no lady, and yet they are in no sense frivolous: they are
terrible and puritanic.</p>

<p>If Daumier by preference showed mastery in his men, Gavarni showed it
in his women as no other has done. He is not the powerful draughtsman
that Daumier is; he has not the feeling for large movement, but with what
terrible directness he analyses faces! He has followed woman through all
seasons of life and in every grade, from youth to decay, and from brilliant
wealth to filthy misery, and he has written the story of the <i>lorette</i> in monumental
strophes: café chantant, villa in the Champs Elysées, equipage,
grooms, Bois de Boulogne, procuress, garret, and radish-woman, that final
incarnation which Victor Hugo called the sentence of judgment.</p>

<p>And Gavarni went further on this road. His glance became sharper and
sharper, and the seriousness
of meditation subdued his
merriment; he came to the
study of his age with the
relentless knife of a vivisectionist.
Fate had taught him
the meaning of the struggle
for existence. A journal he
had founded in the thirties
overwhelmed him with debts.
In 1835 he sat in the prison
of Clichy, and from that time
he meditated on the miserable,
tattered creatures whom
he saw around him, with
other eyes. He studied the
toiling masses, and roamed
about in slums and wine-caves
amongst pickpockets
and bullies. And what Paris
had not yet revealed to him,
he learnt in 1849 in London.
Even there he was not the
first-comer. Géricault, who
as early as 1821 dived into
the misery of the vast city,
and brought out a series of
lithographs, showed him the
way. Beggars cowering half
dead with exhaustion at a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>44</span>
baker&rsquo;s door, ragged pipers slouching round deserted quarters of the town,
poor crippled women wheeled in barrows by hollow-eyed men past splendid
mansions and surrounded by the throng of brilliant equipages&mdash;these are
some of the scenes which he brought home with him from London. But
Gavarni excels him in trenchant incisiveness. &ldquo;What is to be seen in London
gratis,&rdquo; runs the heading of a series of sketches in which he conjures up on
paper, in such a terrible manner, the new horrors of this new period: the
starvation, the want, and the measureless suffering that hides itself with
chattering teeth in the dens of the great city. He went through Whitechapel
from end to end, and studied its drunkenness and its vice. How much more
forcible are his beggars than those of Callot! The grand series of &ldquo;Thomas
Vireloque&rdquo; is a dance of death in life; and in it are stated all the problems
which have since disturbed our epoch. By this work Gavarni has come down
to us as a contemporary, and by it he has become a pioneer. The enigmatical
figure of &ldquo;Thomas Vireloque&rdquo; starts up in these times, following step by
step in the path of his prototype: he is the philosopher of the back streets,
the ragged scoundrel with dynamite in his pocket, the incarnation of the
<i>bête humaine</i>, of human misery
and human vice. Here Gavarni
stands far above Hogarth and
far above Callot. The ideas on
social politics of the first half of
the century are concentrated in
&ldquo;Thomas Vireloque.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course the assumption of
government by Napoleon <span class="sc">III</span>
marked a new phase in French
caricature. It became more mundane
and more highly civilised.
All the piquancy and brilliance,
waywardness and corruption,
looseness and amenity, mirth
and affectation of this refined
city life, which in those days
threw its dazzling splendour over
all Europe, found intelligent and
subtle interpreters in the young
generation of draughtsmen. The
<i>Journal pour rire</i> comes under consideration
as the leading paper.
It was founded in 1848, and in
1856 assumed the title of <i>Journal
amusant</i>, under which it is known
at the present day.</p>

<i>Gustave Doré</i>, to the lessening of his importance, moved on this ground only
in his earliest period. He was barely sixteen and still at school in his native
town Burg, in Alsace, when he made an agreement with Philippon, who
engaged him for three years on the <i>Journal pour rire</i>. His first drawings
date from 1844: &ldquo;Les animaux socialistes,&rdquo; which were very suggestive of
Grandville, and &ldquo;Désagréments d&rsquo;un voyage d&rsquo;agrément&rdquo;&mdash;something like
the German <i>Herr und Frau Buchholz in der Schweiz</i>&mdash;which made a considerable
sensation by their grotesque wit. In his series &ldquo;Les différents
publics de Paris&rdquo; and &ldquo;La Ménagerie Parisienne&rdquo; he represented with
an incisive pencil the opera, the <i>Théâtre des Italiens</i>, the circus, the <i>Odéon</i>
and the <i>Jardin des Plantes</i>. But since that time the laurels of historical
painting have given him no rest. He turned away from his own age as well
as from caricature, and made excursions into all zones and all periods. He
visited the Inferno with Dante, lingered in Palestine with the patriarchs of
the Old Testament, and ran through the world of wonders with Perrault.
The facility of his invention was astonishing, and so too was the aptness with
which he seized for illustration on the most vivid scenes from all authors. But
he has too much Classicism to be captivating for very long. His compositions
dazzle by an appearance of the grand style, but attain only an outward and
scenical effect. His figures are academic variations of types originally established
by the Greeks and the Cinquescentisti. He forced his talent when
he soared into regions where he could not stand without the support of his
predecessors. Even in his &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; the figures lose in character the larger
they become. Everything in Doré is calligraphic, judicious, without individuality,
without movement and life, composed in accordance with known rules.
There is a touch of Wiertz in him, both in his imagination and in his design,
and his youthful works, such as the &ldquo;Swiss Journey,&rdquo; in which he merely drew
from observation without pretensions to style, will probably last the longest.</p>

<p>In broad lithographs and charming woodcuts, <i>Cham</i> has been the most
exhaustive in writing up the diary of modern Parisian life during the period
1848-78. The celebrated caricaturist&mdash;he has been called the most brilliant
man in France under Napoleon <span class="sc">III</span>&mdash;had worked in the studio of Delaroche
at the same time as Jean François Millet. After 1842 he came forward as
Cham (his proper name was Count Amadée de Noë) with drawings which soon
made him the artist most in demand on the staff of the <i>Charivari</i>. Neither
so profound nor so serious as Gavarni, he has a constant sparkle of vivacity,
and is a draughtsman of wonderful <i>verve</i>. In his reviews of the month and of
the year, everything which interested Paris in the provinces of invention and
fashion, art and literature, science and the theatre, passes before us in turn:
the omnibuses with their high imperials, table-turning and spirit-rapping,
the opening of the <i>Grands Magasins du Louvre</i>, Madame Ristori, the completion
of the Suez Canal, the first newspaper kiosks, New Year&rsquo;s Day in Paris, the
invention of ironclads, the tunnelling of Mont Cenis, Gounod&rsquo;s <i>Faust</i>, Patti
and Nilsson, the strike of the tailors and hat-makers, jockeys and racing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>48</span>
Everything that excited public attention had a close observer in Cham. His
caricatures of the works of art in the Salon were full of spirit, and the International
Exhibition of 1867 found in him its classic chronicler. Here all the
mysterious Paris of the third Napoleon lives once more. Emperors and kings
file past, the band of Strauss plays, gipsies are dancing, equipages roll by, and
every one lives, loves, flirts, squanders money, and whirls round in a maëlstrom.
But the end of the exhibition betokened the end of all that splendour. In
Cham&rsquo;s plates which came next one feels that there is thunder in the air.
Neither fashions nor theatres, neither women nor pleasure, could prevent politics
from predominating more and more: the fall of Napoleon was drawing near.</p>

<p>There was a greater division of labour amongst those who followed Cham,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>49</span>
since one chose &ldquo;little women&rdquo; as a speciality, another the theatre, and
another high-life. Assisted by photography, <i>Nadar</i> turned again to portraiture,
which had been neglected since Daumier, and enjoyed a great success with
his series &ldquo;Les Contemporains de Nadar.&rdquo; <i>Marcellin</i> is the first who spread
over his sketches from the world of fashions and the theatre all the <i>chic</i> and
fashionable glitter which lives in the novels of those years. He is the chronicler
of the great world, of balls and <i>soirées</i>; he shows the opera and the <i>Théâtre
des Italiens</i>, tells of hunting and racing, attends the drives in the Corso, and
at the call of fashion promptly deserts the stones of Paris to look about him
in châteaux and country-houses, seaside haunts in France, and the little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>50</span>
watering-places of Germany, where the gaming-tables formed at that time
the rendezvous of well-bred Paris. Baden-Baden, where all the lions of the
day, the politicians and the artists and all the beauties of the Paris salons,
met together in July, offered the draughtsman a specially wide field for studies
of fashion and <i>chic</i>. Here began the series &ldquo;Histoires des variations de la
mode depuis le XVI siècle jusqu&rsquo;à nos jours.&rdquo; In a place where all classes of
society, the great world and the <i>demi-monde</i>, came into contact, Marcellin
could not avoid the latter, but even when he verged on this province he always
knew how to maintain a correct and distinguished bearing. He was peculiarly
the draughtsman of &ldquo;society,&rdquo; of that brilliant, pleasure-loving, tainted, and
yet refined society of the Second Empire which turned Paris into a great ball-room.</p>

<p><i>Randon</i> is as plebeian as Marcellin is aristocratic. His speciality is the stupid
recruit who is marched through the streets with his &ldquo;squad,&rdquo; or the retired
tradesman of small means, as Daudet has hit him off in M. Chèbe, the old
gentleman seated on a bench in the Bois de Boulogne: &ldquo;Let the little ones
come to me with their nurses.&rdquo; His province includes everything that has
nothing to do with <i>chic</i>. The whole life of the Parisian people, the horse-fairs,
the races at Poissy, and all the more important occurrences by which the
appearance of the city has been transformed, may be followed in his drawings.
When he travelled he did not go to
watering-places, but to the provinces,
to Cherbourg and Toulon, or to the
manufacturing towns of Belgium and
England, where he observed life at the
railway stations and the custom-house,
at markets and in barracks, at seaports
and upon the street. Goods that are
being piled together, sacks that are
being hoisted, ships being brought to
anchor, storehouses, wharfs, and docks&mdash;everywhere
there is as much life in
his sketches as in a busy beehive.
Nature is a great manufactory, and
man a living machine. The world is
like an ant-hill, the dwelling of curious
insects furnished with teeth, feelers,
indefatigable feet, and marvellous
organs proper for digging, sawing,
building, and all things possible, but
furnished also with an incessant
hunger.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards there came <i>Hadol</i>,
who made his début in 1855, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>51</span>
pictures of the fashions; <i>Stop</i>,
who specially represented the
provinces and Italy; <i>Draner</i>,
who occupied himself with the
Parisian ballet and designed
charming military uniforms
for little dancing girls. <i>Léonce
Petit</i> drew peasants and
sketched the charms of the
country in a simple, familiar
fashion&mdash;the mortal tedium of
little towns, poor villages, and
primitive inns, the gossip of
village beldames before the
house-door, the pompous dignity
of village magistrates or
of the head of the fire brigade.
He is specially noteworthy as
a landscape artist. The trees
on the straight, monotonous
road rise softly and delicately
into the air, and the sleepy
sameness of tortuous village
streets is pregnantly rendered
by a few strokes of the pencil.
The land is like a great
kitchen garden. The fields
and the arable ground with
their dusty, meagre soil chant
a mighty song of hard labour, of the earnest, toilsome existence of the
peasant folk.</p>

<p><i>Andrieux</i> and <i>Morland</i> discovered the <i>femme entretenue</i>, though afterwards
her best known delineator was <i>Grévin</i>, an able, original, facile, and piquant
draughtsman, whom some&mdash;exaggerating beyond a doubt&mdash;called the direct
successor of Gavarni. Grévin&rsquo;s women are a little monotonous, with their
ringleted chignons, their expressionless eyes which try to look big, their perverse
little noses, their defiant, pouting lips, and the cheap toilettes which they
wear with so much <i>chic</i>. But they too have gone to their rest with the grisettes
of Monnier and Gavarni, and have left the field to the women of Mars
and Forain. In these days Grévin&rsquo;s work seems old-fashioned, since it is no
longer modern and not yet historical; nevertheless it marks an epoch, like
that of Gavarni. The <i>bals publics</i>, the <i>bals de l&rsquo;Opéra</i>, those of the <i>Jardin
Mabille</i>, the <i>Closerie des Lilas</i>, the races, the promenades in the <i>Bois de Vincennes</i>,
the seaside resorts, all places where the <i>demi-monde</i> pitched its tent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>52</span>
in the time of Napoleon <span class="sc">III</span>, were also the home of the artist. &ldquo;How they
love in Paris&rdquo; and &ldquo;Winter in Paris&rdquo; were his earliest series. His finest
and greatest drawings, the scenes from the Parisian hotels and &ldquo;The English
in Paris,&rdquo; appeared in 1867, the year of the Exhibition. His later series,
published as albums&mdash;&ldquo;Les filles d&rsquo;Ève,&rdquo; &ldquo;Le monde amusant,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fantaisies
parisiennes,&rdquo; &ldquo;Paris vicieux,&rdquo; &ldquo;La Chaîne des Dames&rdquo;&mdash;are a song of songs
upon the refinements of life.</p>

<p>It does not lie within the plan of this book to follow the history of drawing
any further. Our intention was merely to show that painting had to follow the
path trodden by Rowlandson and Cruikshank, Erhard and Richter, Daumier
and Gavarni, if it was to be art of the nineteenth century, and not to remain
for ever dependent on the old masters. Absolute beauty is not good food for
art; to be strong it must be nourished on the ideas of the century. When
the world had ceased to draw inspiration from the masterpieces of the past
merely with the object of depicting by their aid scenes out of long-buried
epochs, there was for the first time a prospect that mere discipleship would be
overcome, and that a new and original painting would be developed through
the fresh and independent study of nature. The passionate craving of the age
had to be this: to feel at home on the earth, in this long-neglected world of
reality, which hides the unsuspected treasure of vivid works of art. The
rising sun is just as beautiful now as on the first day, the streams flow, the
meadows grow green, the vibrating passions are at war now as in other times,
the immortal heart of nature still beats beneath its rough covering, and its
pulsation finds an echo in the heart of man. It was necessary to descend
from ideals to existing fact, and the world had to be once more discovered by
painters as in the days of the first Renaissance. The question was how by
the aid of all the devices of colour to represent the multifarious forms of
human activity: the phases and conditions of life, fashion as well as misery,
work and pleasure, the drawing-room and the street, the teeming activity
of towns and the quiet labour of peasants. The essential thing was to write
the entire natural history of the age. And this way, the way from museums
to nature, and from the past to the world of living men, was shown by the
English to the French and German painters.</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER XVII</p>

<p class="center chap2">ENGLISH PAINTING TO 1850</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">&ldquo;The</span> English school has an advantage over others in being young: its
tradition is barely a century old, and, unlike the Continental schools,
it is not hampered by antiquated Greek and Latin theories. What fortunate
conditions it has for breaking away into really modern work! whereas in
other nations the weight of tradition presses hard on the boldest innovators.
The English do not look back; on the contrary, they look into life around
them.&rdquo; So wrote Burger-Thoré in one of his Salons in 1867.</p>

<p>Yet England was not unaffected by the retrospective tendency on the
Continent. Perhaps it might even be demonstrated that this movement had
its earliest origin on British soil. England had its &ldquo;Empire style&rdquo; in architecture
fifty years before there was any empire in France; it had its Classical
painting when David worked at Cupids with Boucher, and it gave the world
a Romanticist at the very time when the literature of the Continent became
&ldquo;Classical.&rdquo; <i>The Lady of the Lake</i>, <i>Marmion</i>, <i>The Lord of the Isles</i>, <i>The Fair
Maid of Perth</i>, <i>Old Mortality</i>, <i>Ivanhoe</i>, <i>Quentin Durward</i>, who is there that
does not know these names by heart? We have learnt history from Walter
Scott, and that programme of the artistic crafts which Lorenz Gedon drew
up in 1876, when he arranged the department <i>Works of our Fathers</i> in the
Munich Exhibition, had been carried out by Scott as early as 1816. For Scott
laid out much of the money he received for his romances in building himself
a castle in the style of the baronial strongholds of the Middle Ages: &ldquo;Towers
and turrets all imitated from a royal building in Scotland, windows and gables
painted with the arms of the clans, with lions couchant,&rdquo; rooms &ldquo;filled with
high sideboards and carved chests, targes, plaids, Highland broadswords,
halberts, and suits of armour, and adorned with antlers hung up as trophies.&rdquo;
Here was a Makartesque studio very many years before Makart.</p>

<p>Amongst the painters there were Classicists and Romanticists; but they
were neither numerous nor of importance. What England produced in the
way of &ldquo;great art&rdquo; in the beginning of last century could be erased from the
complete chart of British painting without any essential gap being made in
the course of its development. Reynolds had had to pay dear for approaching
the Italians in his &ldquo;Ugolino,&rdquo; his &ldquo;Macbeth,&rdquo; and his &ldquo;Young Hercules.&rdquo;
And a yet more arid mannerism befell all the others who followed him on the
way to Italy, among them <i>James Barry</i>, who, after studying for years in Italy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>54</span>
settled down in London in 1771, with the avowed intention of providing
England with a classical form of art. He believed that he had surpassed his
own models, the Italian classic painters, by six pompous representations of
the &ldquo;Culture and Progress of Human Knowledge,&rdquo; which he completed in
1783, in the theatre of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts. The many-sided
<i>James Northcote</i>, equally mediocre in everything, survives rather by his
biographies of Reynolds and Titian than by the great canvases which he
painted for Boydell&rsquo;s Shakespeare Gallery. That which became best known
was &ldquo;The Murder of the Children in the Tower.&rdquo; <i>Henry Fuseli</i>, who was also
much occupied with authorship and as <i>preceptor Britanniæ</i>, always mentioned
with great respect by his numerous pupils, produced a series of exceedingly
thoughtful and imaginative works, to which he was incited by Klopstock and
Lavater. By preference he illustrated Milton and Shakespeare, and amongst
this series of pictures his painting of &ldquo;Titania with the Ass,&rdquo; from Shakespeare&rsquo;s
<i>Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</i>, in the London National Gallery, is probably
the best. His pupil <i>William Etty</i> was saturated with the traditions of
the Venetian school; he is the British Makart, and followed rather heavily
and laboriously in the track of Titian, exploring the realms of nude beauty,
and toiling to discover that secret of blooming colour which gleams from the
female forms of the Venetians. The assiduous <i>Benjamin Robert Haydon</i>, a
spirit ever seeking, striving, and reflecting, became, like Gros in France, a
victim of the grand style. He would naturally have preferred to paint otherwise,
and more simply. The National Gallery possesses a charming picture
by him of a London street (for some years past on loan at Leicester), which
represents a crowd watching a Punch and Judy show. But, like Gros, he
held it a sin against the grand style to occupy himself with such matters. He
thought it only permissible to paint sacred subjects or subjects from ancient
history upon large spaces of canvas; and he sank ever deeper into his theories,
reaching the profoundest abyss of abstract science when he made diligent
anatomical studies of the muscles of a lion, in order to fashion the heroic
frames of warriors on the same plan. His end, on 26th June 1846, was like
that of the Frenchman. There was found beside his body a paper on which
he had written: &ldquo;God forgive me. Amen. Finis,&rdquo; with the quotation
from Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>Lear</i>: &ldquo;Stretch me no longer on the rack of this rough
world.&rdquo; All these masters are more interesting for their human qualities than
for their works, which, with their extravagant colour, forced gestures, and
follies of every description, contain no new thing worthy of further development.
Even when they sought to make direct copies from Continental performances,
they did not attain the graceful sweep of their models. The
refinements which they imitated became clumsy and awkward in their hands,
and they remained half <i>bourgeois</i> and half barbaric.</p>

<p>The liberating influence of English art was not found in the province of the
great painting, and it is probably not without significance that the few who
tried to import it came to grief in the experiment. There can be no doubt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>55</span>
that such art goes more against the grain of the English nature than of any
other. Even in the days of scholastic philosophy the English asserted the
doctrine that there are only individuals in nature. In the beginning of
modern times a new era,
grounded on the observation
of nature, was promulgated
from England.
Bacon had little to say
about beauty: he writes
against the proportions
and the principle of selection
in art, and therefore
against the ideal. Handsome
men, he says, have
seldom possessed great
qualities. And in the same
way the English stage had
just as little bent for
the august and rhythmical
grandeur of classical literature.
When he stabbed
Polonius, Garrick never
dreamed of moving according
to the taste of Boileau,
and was probably as different from the Greek leader of a chorus as Hogarth
from David. The peculiar merits of English literature and science have been
rooted from the time of their first existence in their capacity for observation.
This explains the contempt for regularity in Shakespeare, the feeling for
concrete fact in Bacon. English philosophy is positive, exact, utilitarian,
and highly moral. Hobbes and Locke, John Stuart Mill and Buckle, in
England take the place of Descartes, Spinoza, Leibnitz, and Kant upon the
Continent. Amongst English historians Carlyle is the only poet: all the
rest are learned prose-writers who collect observations, combine experiences,
arrange dates, weigh possibilities, reconcile facts, discover laws, and hoard
and increase positive knowledge. The eighteenth century had seen the rise of
the novel as the picture of contemporary life; in Hogarth this national spirit
was first turned to account in painting. In the beginning of the nineteenth
century, again, the good qualities of English art consisted not in bold ideality,
but in sharpness of observation, sobriety, and flexibility of spirit.</p>

<p>Their proper domain was still to be found in portraiture, and if none of
the new portrait painters can be compared with the great ancestors of English
art, they are none the less superior to all their contemporaries on the
Continent. <i>George Romney</i>, who belongs rather to the eighteenth century,
holds the mean course between the refined classic art of Sir Joshua and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>56</span>
imaginative poetic art of Thomas Gainsborough. Less personal and less
profound in characterisation, he was, on the other hand, the most dexterous
painter of drapery in his age: a man who knew all the secrets of the trade,
and possessed, at the same time, that art which is so much valued in portrait
painters&mdash;the art of beautifying his models without making his picture
unlike the original. Professional beauties beheld themselves presented in
their counterfeit precisely as they wished to appear, and accorded him, therefore,
a fervent adoration. And after his return from Italy in 1775 his fame
was so widespread that it outstripped Gainsborough&rsquo;s and equalled that of
Reynolds. Court beauties and celebrated actresses left no stone unturned to
have their portraits introduced into one of his &ldquo;compositions&rdquo;; for Romney
eagerly followed the fashion of allegorical portraiture which had been set
by Reynolds, representing persons with the emblem of a god or of one of the
muses. Romney has painted the famous Lady Hamilton, to say nothing of
others, as Magdalen, Joan of Arc, a Bacchante, and an Odalisque.</p>

<p>Great as his reputation had been at the close of the eighteenth century,
it was outshone twenty years later by that of <i>Sir Thomas Lawrence</i>. Born in
Bristol in 1769, Lawrence had scarcely given up the calling of an actor before
he saw all England in raptures over his genius as a painter. The catalogue
of his portraits is a complete list of all who were at the time pre-eminent for
talent or beauty. He received fabulous sums, which he spent with the grace
of a man of the world. In 1815 he was commissioned to paint for the Windsor
Gallery the portraits of all the
&ldquo;Victors of Waterloo,&rdquo; from the
Duke of Wellington to the Emperor
Alexander. The Congress at Aix-la-Chapelle
gave him an opportunity
for getting the portraits of representatives
of the various Courts.
All the capitals of Europe, which he
visited for this purpose, received
him with princely honours. He
was member of all the Academies
under the sun, and President of
that in London; but, as a natural
reaction, this over-estimation of
earlier years has been followed by an
equally undeserved undervaluation
of his works in these days. Beneath
the fashionable exterior of his
ceremonial pictures naturalness and
simplicity are often wanting, and so
too are the deeper powers of characterisation,
firm drawing, and real
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>57</span>
vitality. A feminine coquetry
has taken the place of character.
His drawing has a banal
effect, and his colouring is
monotonous in comparison
with that realism which Reynolds
shares with the old
masters. It is easy to confound
the majority of his pictures
of ceremonies with those of
Winterhalter, and his smaller
portraits with pretty fashion
plates; yet one cannot but
admire his ease of execution
and nobility of composition.
Several of his pictures of
women, in particular, are
touched by an easy grace and
a fine charm of poetic sensuousness
in which he approaches
Gainsborough. Not many at
that time could have painted
such pretty children&rsquo;s heads, or
given young women such an
attractive and familiar air of life. With what a girlish glance of innocence
and melancholy does Mrs. Siddons look out upon the world from the
canvas of Lawrence: how piquant is her white Greek garment, with its
black girdle and the white turban. And what subtle delicacy there is in
the portrait of Miss Farren as she flits with muff and fur-trimmed cloak
through a bright green summer landscape. The reputation of Lawrence will
rise once more when his empty formal pieces have found their way into lumber-rooms,
and a greater number of his pictures of women&mdash;pictures so full of
indescribable fascination, so redolent of mysterious charm&mdash;are accessible to
the public.</p>

<p>As minor stars, the soft and tender <i>John Hoppner</i>, the attractively superficial
<i>William Beechey</i>, the celebrated pastellist <i>John Russell</i>, and the vigorously
energetic <i>John Jackson</i> had their share with him in public favour, whilst
<i>Henry Raeburn</i> shone in Scotland as a star of the first magnitude.</p>

<p>He was a born painter. Wilkie says in one of his letters from Madrid,
that the pictures of Velasquez put him in mind of Raeburn; and certain
works of the Scot, such as the portrait of Lord Newton, the famous <i>bon vivant</i>
and doughty drinker, are indeed performances of such power that comparison
with this mighty name is no profanation. At a time when there was a danger
that portrait painting would sink in the hands of Lawrence into an insipid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>58</span>
painting of prettiness, Raeburn
stood alone by the
simplicity and naturalistic
impressiveness of his portraiture.
The three hundred
and twenty-five portraits by
him which were exhibited in
the Royal Scottish Academy
in 1876, gave as exhaustive a
picture of the life of Edinburgh
at the close of the
century as those of Sir Joshua
gave of the life of London.
All the celebrated Scotchmen
of his time&mdash;Robertson,
Hume, Ferguson, and Scott&mdash;were
painted by him. Altogether
he painted over six
hundred portraits; and, small
though the number may seem
compared with the two thousand
of Reynolds, Raeburn&rsquo;s
artistic qualities are almost
the greater. The secret of
his success lies in his vigorous
healthiness, in the indescribable
<i>furia</i> of his brush, in the harmony and truth of his colour-values. His
figures are informed by a startling intensity of life. His old pensioners, and
his sailors in particular, have something kingly in the grand air of their calm
and noble countenances. Armstrong has given him a place between Frans
Hals and Velasquez, and occasionally his conception of colour even recalls
the modern Frenchmen, as it were Manet in his Hals period. He paints his
models, just as they come into contact with him in life, in the frank light of
day and without any attempt at the dusk of the old masters; of raiment he
gives only as much as the comprehension of the picture demands, and
depicts character in large and simple traits.</p>

<p>The importance of West and Copley, two Americans who were active in
England, is that they were the first to apply the qualities acquired in English
portrait painting to pictures on a large scale.</p>

<p><i>Benjamin West</i> has undoubtedly been over-praised by his contemporaries,
and by a critic of the present day he has, not unfairly, been designated &ldquo;the
king of mediocrity.&rdquo; At his appearance he was interesting to Europeans
merely as an anthropological curiosity,&mdash;as the first son of barbaric America
who had used a paint brush. A thoroughly American puff preceded his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>59</span>
entry into the Eternal City in 1760. It was reported that as the son of a
quaker farmer he had grown up amongst his father&rsquo;s slaves in the immediate
neighbourhood of the Indians, and had painted good portraits in Philadelphia
and New York without having ever seen a work of art. People were delighted
when, on being brought into the Vatican, he clapped his hands and compared
the Apollo Belvidere to an Indian chief. In the art of making himself interesting
&ldquo;the young savage&rdquo; was ahead of all his patrons; and as he followed
the ruling classical tendency with great aptitude, within the course of a year
he was made an honorary member of the Academies of Parma, Bologna, and
Florence, and praised by the critics of Rome as ranking with Mengs as the
first painter of his day. In 1763, at a time when Hogarth and Reynolds,
Wilson and Gainsborough, were in the fulness of their powers, he went to
London; and as people are always inclined to value most highly what they
do not possess, he soon won an important position for himself, even beside
these masters. Hogarth produced nothing but &ldquo;<i>genre</i> pictures,&rdquo; Wilson
only landscapes, and Reynolds and Gainsborough portraits: West brought
to the English what they did not as yet possess&mdash;a &ldquo;great art.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His first picture&mdash;in the London National Gallery&mdash;&ldquo;Pylades and Orestes
brought as Hostages before Iphigenia,&rdquo; is a tiresome product of that Classicism
which upon the Continent found its principal representatives in Mengs and
David: it is stiff in drawing,
its composition is suggestive
of a bas-relief, and its cold
grey colouring is classically
academic. His other pictures
from antique and sacred history
stand much on the same
level as those of Wilhelm
Kaulbach, with whose works
they share their stilted dignity,
their systematically
antiquarian structure, and
their mechanical combination
of forms borrowed in a
spiritless fashion from the
Cinquecentisti.</p>

<p>Fortunately West has left
behind him something different
from these ambitious
attempts; for on the occasions
when he turned away
from the great style he created
works of lasting importance.
This is specially true
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>60</span>
of some fine historical pictures dealing with his own age, which will preserve his
name for ever. &ldquo;The Death of General Wolfe&rdquo; at the storming of Quebec on
13th September 1759&mdash;exhibited at the opening of the Royal Academy in
1768&mdash;is by its very sobriety a sincere, honest, and sane piece of work, which
will maintain its value as an historical document. It was just at this time
that so great a part was played by the question of costume, and West encountered
the same difficulties which Gottfried Schadow was obliged to face when
he represented Ziethen and the Old Dessauer in the costume of their age.
The connoisseurs held that such a sublime theme would only admit of antique
dress. If West in their despite represented the general and his soldiers in
their regulation uniform, it seems at the present time no more than the result
of healthy common sense, but at that time it was an artistic event of great
importance, and one which was only accomplished in France after the work
of several decades. In that country Gérard and Girodet still clung to the
belief that they could only raise the military picture to the level of the great
style by giving the soldiers of the Empire the appearance of Greek and Roman
statues. Gros is honoured as the man who first ceased from giving modern
soldiers an air of the antique. But the American Englishman had anticipated
him by forty years. As in Géricault&rsquo;s &ldquo;Raft of the Medusa,&rdquo; it was only the
pyramidal composition in West&rsquo;s picture that betrayed the painter&rsquo;s alliance
with the Classical school; in other respects it forecast the realistic programme
for decades to come, and indicated the course of development which leads
through Gros onwards. If in Gros men are treated purely as accessories to
throw a hero into relief, in West they stand out in action. They behave in
the picture spontaneously as they do in life. That is to say, there is in West&rsquo;s
work of 1768 the element through which Horace Vernet&rsquo;s pictures of 1830 are
to be distinguished from those of Gros.</p>

<p>This realistic programme was carried out with yet greater consistency
by West&rsquo;s younger compatriot <i>John Singleton Copley</i>, who after a short sojourn
in Italy migrated to England in 1775. His chief works in the London
National Gallery depict in the same way events from contemporary history&mdash;&ldquo;The
Death of the Earl of Chatham, 7th April 1778&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Death
of Major Pierson, 6th January 1781,&rdquo;&mdash;and it is by no means impossible
that when David, in the midst of the classicising tendencies of his age, ventured
to paint &ldquo;The Death of Marat&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Death of Lepelletier,&rdquo; he was
led to do so by engravings after Copley. In the representation of such things
other painters of the epoch had draped their figures in antique costume,
called genii and river-gods into action, and given a Roman character to the
whole. Copley, like West, offers a plain, matter-of-fact representation of
the event, without any rhetorical pathos. And what raises him above West
is his liquid, massive colour, suggestive of the old masters. In none of his
works could West set himself free from the dead grey colour of the Classical
school, whereas Copley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Death of William Pitt&rdquo; is the result of intimate
studies of Titian and the Dutch. The way the light falls on the perukes of
the men and the
brown, wainscoted
walls puts one in
mind of Rembrandt&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Anatomical Lecture&rdquo;;
only, instead
of a pathetic scene
from the theatre, we
have a collection of
good portraits in the
manner of the Dutch
studies of shooting
matches.</p>

<p>That this unhackneyed
conception
of daily life has
its special home in
England is further
demonstrated by the
work of <i>Daniel Maclise</i>,
who depicted
&ldquo;The Meeting of
Wellington and
Blücher,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Death of Nelson,&rdquo;
and other patriotic
themes upon walls and canvases several yards square, with appalling energy,
promptitude, and expenditure of muscle. By these he certainly did better
service to national pride than to art. Nevertheless, with their forcible, healthy
realism they contrast favourably with the mythological subjects so universally
produced on the Continent at that time.</p>

<p>Beside the portrait painters of men stand the portrait painters of animals.
Since the days of Elias Riedinger animal painting had fallen into general
disesteem on the Continent. Thorwaldsen, the first of the Classicists who
allowed animals to appear in his works (as he did in his Alexander frieze),
dispensed with any independent studies of nature, and contented himself with
imitating the formal models on the frieze of the Parthenon; or, in lack of
a Grecian exemplar, simply drew out of the depths of his inner consciousness.
Especially remarkable is the sovran contempt with which he treated the
most familiar domestic creatures. German historical painting knew still
less what to make of the brute creation, because it only recognised beauty
in the profundity of ideas, and ideas have nothing to do with beasts. Its
four-footed creatures have a philosophic depth of contemplation, and are
bad studies after nature. Kaulbach&rsquo;s &ldquo;Reinecke&rdquo; and the inclination to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>64</span>
transplant human sentiments into the world of brutes delayed until the sixties
any devoted study of the animal soul. France, too, before the days of Troyon,
had nothing to show worth mentioning. But in England, the land of sport,
animal painting was evolved directly from the old painting of the chase,
without being seduced from its proper course. Fox-hunting has been popular
in England since the time of Charles <span class="sc">I</span>. Racing came into fashion not long
after, and with racing came that knowledge of horseflesh which has been
developed in England further than elsewhere. Since the seventeenth century
red deer have been preserved in the English parks. It is therefore comprehensible
that English art was early occupied with these animals, and since it
was sportsmen who cared most about them, the painter was at first their
servant. He had not so much to paint pictures as reminiscences of sport
and the chase. His first consideration in painting a horse was to paint a fine
horse; as to its being a fine picture, that was quite a secondary matter. <i>John
Wootton</i> and <i>George Stubbs</i> were in this sense portrayers of racehorses. The
latter, however, took occasion to emancipate himself from his patrons by
representing the noble animal, not standing at rest by his manger, or with a
groom on his back and delighting in the consciousness of his own beauty,
but as he was in action and amongst pictorial surroundings.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards <i>George Morland</i> made his appearance. He made a specialty
of old nags, and was perhaps the most important master of the brush
that the English school produced at all. His pictures have the same magic
as the landscapes of Gainsborough. He painted life on the high-road and
in front of village inns&mdash;scenes like those which Isaac Ostade had represented
a century before: old horses being led to water amid the sunny landscape
of the downs, market carts rumbling heavily through the rough and sunken
lanes, packhorses coming back to their stalls of an evening tired out with
the day&rsquo;s exertions, riders pulling up at the village inn or chatting with the
pretty landlady. And he has done these things with the delicacy of an old
Dutch painter. It is impossible to say whether Morland had ever seen the
pictures of Adriaen Brouwer; but this greatest master of technique amongst
the Flemings can alone be compared with Morland in verve and artistic many-sidedness;
and Morland resembled him also in his adventurous life and his
early death. To the spirit and dash of Brouwer he joins the refinement of
Gainsborough in his landscapes, and Rowlandson&rsquo;s delicate feeling for feminine
beauty in his figures. He does not paint fine ladies, but women in their
everyday clothes, and yet they are surrounded by a grace recalling Chardin:
young mothers going to see their children who are with the nurse, smart little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>68</span>
tavern hostesses in their white aprons and coquettish caps busily serving
riders with drink, and charming city madams in gay summer garb sitting
of a Sunday afternoon with their children at a tea-garden. Over the works
of Morland there lies all the chivalrous grace of the time of Werther, and that
fine Anglo-Saxon aroma exhaled by the works of English painters of the
present day. Genuine as is the fame which he enjoys as an animal painter,
it is these little social scenes which show his finest side; and only coloured
engraving, which was brought to such a high pitch in the England of those
days, is able to give an idea of the delicacy of hue in the originals.</p>

<p>Morland&rsquo;s brother-in-law, the painter and engraver <i>James Ward</i>, born
in 1769 and dying in 1859, united this old English school with the modern.
The portrait which accompanies the obituary notice in the <i>Art Journal</i> is
that of a very aged gentleman, with a grey beard and thick, white, bristly
hair. The pictures which he painted when he had this appearance&mdash;and
they are the most familiar&mdash;were exceedingly weak and insipid works. In
comparison with Morland&rsquo;s broad, liquid, and harmonious painting, that of
Ward seems burnished, sparkling, flaunting, anecdotic, and petty. But
James Ward was not always old James Ward. In his early days he was one
of the greatest and manliest artists of the English school, with whom only
Briton Rivière can be compared amongst the moderns. When his &ldquo;Lioness&rdquo;
appeared in the Royal Academy Exhibition of 1816 he was justly hailed as
the best animal painter after Snyders, and from that time one masterpiece
followed another for ten long years. What grace and power there are in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>69</span>
horses and dogs! In pictures of this sort Stubbs was graceful and delicate;
Ward painted the same horse in as sporting a manner and with the same
knowledge, but with an artistic power such as no one had before him. His
field of work was wide-reaching. He painted little girls with the thoroughly
English feeling of Morland, and had the whole animal world for his domain.
Lions, snakes, cats, pigs, oxen, cows, sheep, swans, fowls, frogs are the characters
in his pictures. And characters they were, for he never humanised
the looks of his four-footed models, as others did later. The home of his
animals is not the drawing-room, but the woods and meadows, the air and
the gardens. His broad, weighty manner was transformed first into extravagant
virtuosity and then into pettiness of style during the last thirty years
of his life, when he became senile. His reputation paled more than he deserved
before the star of the world-famous Landseer.</p>

<p>The most popular animal painter, not merely of England but of the whole
century, was <i>Edwin Landseer</i>. For fifty years his works formed the chief
features of attraction in the Royal Academy. Engravings from him had
such a circulation in the country that in the sixties there was scarcely a house
in which there did not hang one of his horses or dogs or stags. Even the
Continent was flooded with engravings of his pictures, and Landseer suffered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>70</span>
greatly from this popularity. He is much better than the reproductions
with their fatal gloss allow any one to suppose, and his pictures can be judged
by them just as little as can Raphael&rsquo;s &ldquo;School of Athens&rdquo; from Jacobi&rsquo;s
engraving.</p>

<p>Edwin Landseer came of a family of artists. His father, who was an
engraver, sent him out into the free world of nature as a boy, and made him
sketch donkeys and goats and sheep. When he was fourteen he went to
Haydon, the prophet on matters of art; and, on the advice of this singular
being, studied the sculptures of the Parthenon. He &ldquo;anatomised animals
under my eyes,&rdquo; writes Haydon, &ldquo;copied my anatomical drawings, and applied
my principles of instruction to animal painting. His genius, directed in this
fashion, has, as a matter of fact, arrived at satisfactory results.&rdquo; Landseer
was the spoilt child of fortune. There is no other English painter who can
boast of having been made a member of the Royal Academy at twenty-four.
In high favour at Court, honoured by the fashionable world, and tenderly
treated by criticism, he went on his way triumphant. The region over which
he held sway was narrow, but he stood out in it as in life, powerful and commanding.
The exhibition of his pictures which took place after his death
in 1873 contained three hundred
and fourteen oil paintings
and one hundred and forty-six
sketches. The property which
he left amounted to £160,000;
and a further sum of £55,000
was realised by the sale of his
unsold pictures. Even Meissonier,
the best paid painter
of the century, did not leave
behind him five and a half
million francs.</p>

<p>One reason of Landseer&rsquo;s
artistic success is perhaps
due to that in him which was
inartistic&mdash;to his effort to
make animals more beautiful
than they really are, and to
make them the medium for
expressing human sentiment.
All the dogs and horses and
stags which he painted after
1855, and through which he
was made specially familiar
to the great public, are arrayed
in their Sunday clothes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>71</span>
their glossiest hide and their most magnificent horns. And in addition
to this he &ldquo;Darwinises&rdquo; them: that is to say, he tries to make his
animals more than animals; he lends a human sentimental trait to animal
character; and that is what distinguishes him to his disadvantage from really
great animal painters like Potter, Snyders, Troyon, Jadin, and Rosa Bonheur.
He paints the human temperament beneath the animal mask. His stags
have expressive countenances, and his dogs appear to be gifted with reason
and even speech. At one moment there is a philosophic dignity in their
behaviour, and at another a frivolity in their pleasures. Landseer discovered
the sentimentality of dogs, and treated them as capable of culture. His
celebrated picture &ldquo;Jack in Office&rdquo; is almost insulting in its characterisation:
there they are, Jack the sentry, an old female dog like a poor gentlewoman,
another dog like a professional beggar, and so on. And this habit of bringing
animals on the stage, as if they were the actors of tragical, melodramatic, or
farcical scenes, made him a peculiar favourite with the great mass of people.
Nor were his picture-stories merely easy to read and understand; the characteristic
titles he invented for each of them&mdash;&ldquo;Alexander and Diogenes,&rdquo; &ldquo;A
Distinguished Member of the Humane Society,&rdquo; and the like&mdash;excited curiosity
as much as the most carefully selected name of a novel. But this search
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>72</span>
after points and sentimental anecdotes only came into prominence in his last
period, when his technique had degenerated and given way to a shiny polish
and a forced elegance which obliged him to provide extraneous attractions.
His popularity would not be so great, but his artistic importance would be
quite the same, if these last pictures did not exist at all.</p>

<p>But the middle period of Landseer, ranging from 1840 to 1850, contains
masterpieces which set him by the side of the best animal painters of all times
and nations. The well-known portrait of a Newfoundland dog of 1838; that
of the Prince Consort&rsquo;s favourite greyhound of 1841; &ldquo;The Otter Speared&rdquo;
of 1844, with its panting and yelping pack brought to a standstill beneath a
high wall of rock; the dead doe which a fawn is unsuspectingly approaching,
in &ldquo;A Random Shot,&rdquo; 1848; &ldquo;The Lost Sheep&rdquo; of 1850, that wanders
frightened and bleating through a wide and lonely landscape covered with
snow,&mdash;these and many other pictures, in their animation and simple naturalness,
are precious examples of the fresh and delicate observation peculiar
to him at that time. Landseer&rsquo;s portrait reveals to us a robust and serious
man, with a weather-beaten face, a short white beard, and a snub bulldog
nose. Standing six feet high, and having the great heavy figure of a Teuton
stepping out of his aboriginal forest, he was indeed much more like a country
gentleman than a London artist. He was a sportsman who wandered about
all day long in the air with a gun on his arm, and he painted his animal pictures
with all the love and joy of a child of nature. That accounts for their strength,
their convincing power, and their vivid force. It is as if he had become
possessed of a magic cap with which he could draw close to animals without
being observed, and surprise their nature and their inmost life.</p>

<p>Landseer&rsquo;s subject-matter and conception of life are indicated by the
pictures which have been named. Old masters like Snyders and Rubens had
represented the contrast
between man and beast
in their boar and lion
hunts. It was not wild
nature that Landseer depicted,
but nature tamed.
Rubens, Snyders, and
Delacroix displayed their
horses, dogs, lions, and
tigers in bold action, or
in the flame of passion.
But Landseer generally introduced
his animals in
quiet situations&mdash;harmless
and without fear&mdash;in the
course of their ordinary
life.</p>

<p>Horses, which Leonardo, Rubens, Velasquez, Wouwerman, and the earlier
English artists delighted to render, he painted but seldom, and when he
painted them it was with a less penetrating comprehension. But lions, which
had been represented in savage passion or in quiet dignity by artists from
Rubens to Decamps, were for him also a subject of long and exhaustive studies,
which had their results in the four colossal lions round the base of the Nelson
Column in Trafalgar Square. Here the Englishman makes a great advance
on Thorwaldsen, who designed the model for the monument in Lucerne without
ever having seen a lion. Landseer&rsquo;s brutes, both as they are painted
and as they are cast in bronze, are genuine lions, cruel and catlike, although
in savageness and bold passion they are not to be compared with those of
Delacroix, nor with those of his elder compatriot, James Ward. On the
other hand, stags and roes were really first introduced into painting by Landseer.
Those of Robert Hills, who had previously been reckoned the best
painter of stags, are timid, suspicious creatures, while Landseer&rsquo;s are the true
kings of the forest, the shooting of which ought to be punished as an act
of assassination. His principal field of study was the Highlands. Here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>74</span>
he painted these proud
creatures fighting on the
mountain slopes, swimming
the lake, or as they stand at
a gaze in their quiet beauty.
With what a bold spirit they
raise their heads to snuff the
mountain air, whilst their
antlers show their delight in
battle and the joy of victory.
And how gentle and timid is
the noble, defenceless roe in
Landseer&rsquo;s pictures.</p>

<p>He had also a delight
in painting sheep lost in a
snow-storm. But dogs were
his peculiar specialty. Landseer
discovered the dog.
That of Snyders was a
treacherous, snarling cur;
that of Bewick a robber and
a thief. Landseer has made
the dog the companion of
man, an adjunct of human
society, the generous friend
and true comrade who is the last mourner at the shepherd&rsquo;s grave. Landseer
first studied his noble countenance and his thoughtful eyes, and in doing so
he opened a new province to art, in which Briton Rivière went further at a
later period.</p>

<p>But yet another and still wider province was opened to continental
nations by the art of England. In an epoch of archæological resuscitations
and romantic regrets for the past, it brought French and German painters
to a consciousness that the man of the nineteenth century in his daily life
might be a perfectly legitimate subject for art. Engravings after the best
pictures of Wilkie hang round the walls of Louis Knaus&rsquo;s reception-room in
Berlin. And that in itself betrays to us a fragment of the history of art. The
painters who saw the English people with the eyes of Walter Scott, Fielding,
Goldsmith, and Dickens were a generation in advance of those who depicted
the German people in the spirit of Immermann, Auerbach, Gustav Freytag,
and Fritz Reuter. The English advanced quietly on the road trodden by
Hogarth in the eighteenth century, whilst upon the Continent the nineteenth
century had almost completed half its course before art left anything which
will allow future generations to see the men of the period as they really were.
Since the days of Fielding and Goldsmith the novel of manners had been continually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>75</span>
growing. Burns, the poet of the plough, and Wordsworth, the singer
of rustic folk, had given a vogue to that poetry of peasant life and those village
tales which have since gone the round of all Europe. England began at that
time to become the richest country in the world, and great fortunes were
made. Painters were thus obliged to provide for the needs of a new and
wealthy middle class. This fact gives us the explanation both of the merits
and the faults which are characteristic of English <i>genre</i> painting.</p>

<p>In the first quarter of the nineteenth century <i>David Wilkie</i>, the English
Knaus, was the chief <i>genre</i> painter of the world. Born in 1785 in the small
Scotch village of Cults, where his father was the clergyman, he passed a happy
childhood, and possibly had to thank his youthful impressions for the consistent
cheerfulness, the good-humour and kindliness that smile out of his
pictures, and make such a contrast with Hogarth&rsquo;s biting acerbity. At
fourteen he entered the Edinburgh School of Art, where he worked for four
years under the historical painter John Graham. Having returned to Cults,
he painted his landscapes. A fair which he saw in the neighbouring village
gave the impulse for his earliest picture of country life, &ldquo;Pitlessie Fair.&rdquo;
He sold it for five and twenty pounds, and determined in 1805 to try his
luck with this sum in London. In the very next year his &ldquo;Village Politicians&rdquo;
excited attention in the exhibition. From that time he was a popular
artist. Every one of his numerous
pictures&mdash;&ldquo;The Blind
Fiddler,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Card Players,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Rent Day,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Cut
Finger,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Village Festival&rdquo;&mdash;called
forth a storm of
applause. After a short residence
in Paris, where the
Louvre gave him a more intimate
knowledge of the Dutch,
came his masterpieces, &ldquo;Blind-Man&rsquo;s
Buff,&rdquo; &ldquo;Distraining for
Rent,&rdquo; &ldquo;Reading the Will,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Rabbit on the Wall,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Penny Wedding,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Chelsea Pensioners,&rdquo; and so
forth. Even later, after he
had become an Academician,
he kept to plain and simple
themes, in spite of the reproaches
of his colleagues,
who thought that art was
vulgarised by the treatment
of subjects that contained so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>76</span>
little dignity. It was only at the end of his life that he became untrue to himself.
His reverence for Teniers and Ostade was not sufficient to outweigh the
impression made on him during a tour taken in 1825 through Italy, Spain,
Holland, and Germany, by the artistic treasures of the Continent, and especially
Murillo and Velasquez. He said he had long lived in darkness, but from
that time forth could say with the great Correggio: &ldquo;<i>Anch&rsquo; io sono pittore.</i>&rdquo;
He renounced all that he had painted before which had made him famous, and
showed himself to be one of the many great artists of those years who had no
individuality, or ventured to have none. He would have been the Burns of
painting had he remained as he was. And thus he offered further evidence
that the museums and the Muses are contradictory conceptions; since the
modern painter always runs the risk of falling helplessly from one influence
into another, where he is bent on combining the historical student of art with
the artist. Of the pictures that he exhibited after his return in 1829, two dealt
with Italian and three with Spanish subjects. The critics were loud in praise;
he had added a fresh branch of laurel to his crown. Yet, historically considered,
he would stand on a higher pedestal if he had never seen more than
a dozen good pictures of Teniers, Ostade, Metsu, Jan Steen, and Brouwer.
Now he began to copy his travelling sketches in a spiritless fashion; he only
represented <i>pifferari</i>, smugglers, and monks, who, devoid of all originality,
might have been painted by one of the Düsseldorfers. Even &ldquo;John Knox
Preaching,&rdquo; which is probably the best picture of his last period, is no exception.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He seemed to me,&rdquo; writes Delacroix, who saw him in Paris after his
return from Spain,&mdash;&ldquo;he seemed to me to have been carried utterly out of
his depth by the pictures he had seen. How is it that a man of his age can be
so influenced by works which are radically opposed to his own? However,
he died soon after, and, as I have been told, in a very melancholy state of
mind.&rdquo; Death overtook him in 1841, on board the steamer <i>Oriental</i>, just as
he was returning from a tour in Turkey. At half-past eight in the evening
the vessel was brought to, and as the lights of the beacon mingled with those
of the stars the waters passed over the corpse of David Wilkie.</p>

In judging his position in the history of art, only those works come into
consideration which he executed before that journey of 1825. Then he drew
as a labour of love the familiar scenes of the household hearth, the little dramas,
the comic or touching episodes that take place in the village, the festivals,
the dancing, and the sports of the country-folk, and their meeting in the ale-house.
At this time, when as a young painter he merely expressed himself
and was ignorant of the efforts of continental painting, he was an artist of
individuality. In the village he became a great man, and here his fame was
decided; he painted rustics. Even when he first saw the old masters in the
National Gallery their immediate effect on him was merely to influence his
technique. And by their aid Wilkie gradually became an admirable master
of technical detail. His first picture, &ldquo;Pitlessie Fair,&rdquo; in its hardness of
colour recalled a Dutch painter of the type of Jan Molenaer; but from that
time his course was one of constant progress. In &ldquo;The Village Politicians&rdquo;
the influence of Teniers first made itself felt, and it prevailed until 1816. In
this year, when he painted the pretty sketch for &ldquo;Blind-Man&rsquo;s Buff,&rdquo; a warm
gold hue took the place of the cool silver tone; and instead of Teniers, Ostade
became his model. The works in his Ostade manner are rich in colour and
deep and clear in tone. Finally, it was Rembrandt&rsquo;s turn to become his
guiding-star, and &ldquo;The Parish Beadle,&rdquo; in the National Gallery&mdash;a scene of
arrest of the year 1822&mdash;clearly shows with what brilliant success he tried
his luck with Rembrandt&rsquo;s dewy <i>chiaroscuro</i>. It was only in his last period
that he lost all these technical qualities. His &ldquo;Knox&rdquo; of 1832 is hard and
cold and inharmonious in colour.</p>

<p>So long as he kept from historical painting, art meant for him the same
thing as the portrayal of domestic life. Painting, he said, had no other aim
than to reproduce nature and to seek truth. Undoubtedly this must be
applied to Wilkie himself with considerable limitation. Wilkie painted simple
fragments of nature just as little as Hogarth; he invented scenes. Nor was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>80</span>
he even gifted with much power of invention. But he had a fund of innocent
humour, although there were times when it was in danger of becoming much
too childlike. &ldquo;Blind-Man&rsquo;s Buff,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Village Politicians,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Village Festival,&rdquo; pictures which have become so popular through the medium
of engraving, contain all the characteristics of his power of playful observation.
He had no ambition to be a moralist, like Hogarth, but just as little did he
paint the rustic as he is. He dealt only with the absurdities and minor accidents
of life. His was one of those happy dispositions which neither sorrow nor
dream nor excite themselves, but see everything from the humorous side:
he enjoyed his own jests, and looked at life as at a pure comedy; the serious
part of it escaped him altogether. His peasantry know nothing of social
problems; free from want and drudgery, they merely spend their time over
trifles and amuse themselves&mdash;themselves and the frequenters of the exhibition,
for whom they are taking part in a comedy on canvas. If Hogarth had a
biting, sarcastic, scourging, and disintegrating genius, Wilkie is one of those
people who cause one no lasting excitement, but are always satisfied to be
humorous, and laugh with a contented appreciation over their own jokes.</p>

<p>And in general such is the keynote of this English <i>genre</i>. All that was
done in it during the years immediately following is more or less comprised
in the works of the Scotch &ldquo;little master&rdquo;; otherwise it courts the assistance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>81</span>
of English literature, which is always rich in humorists and excellent writers
of anecdote and story. In painting, as in literature, the English delight in
detail, which by its dramatic, anecdotic, or humorous point is intended to have
the interest of a short story. Or perhaps one should rather say that, since
the English came to painting as novices, they began tentatively on that first
step on which art had stood in earlier centuries as long as it was still &ldquo;the
people&rsquo;s spelling-book.&rdquo; It is a typical form of development, and repeats
itself constantly. All painting begins in narrative. First it is the subject
which has a fascination for the artist, and by the aid of it he casts a spell over
his public. The simplification of motives, the capacity for taking a thing in
at a single glance, and finding a simple joy in its essentially pictorial integrity,
is of later growth. Even with the Dutch, who were so eminently gifted with
a sense for what is pictorial, the picture of manners was at first epical. Church
festivals, skating parties, and events which could be represented in an ample
and detailed fashion were the original materials of the <i>genre</i> picture, which
only later contented itself with a purely artistic study of one out of countless
groups. This period of apprenticeship, which may be called the period of
interesting subject-matter, was what England was now going through; and
England had to go through it, since she had the civilisation by which it is
invariably produced.</p>

<td class="tcr f80 pb2">THE PENNY WEDDING.</td></tr></table>

<p>Just as the first <i>genre</i> pictures of the Flemish school announced the appearance
of a <i>bourgeoisie</i>, so in the England of the beginning of the century a new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>82</span>
plebeian, middle-class society had taken the place of the patrons of earlier
days, and this middle class set its seal upon manners and communicated
its spirit to painting. Prosperity, culture, travel, reading, and leisure, everything
which had been the privilege of individuals, now became the common
property of the great mass of men. They prized art, but they demanded
from it substantial nourishment. That two colours in connection with straight
and curved lines are enough for the production of infinite harmonies was still
a profound secret. &ldquo;You are free to be painters if you like,&rdquo; artists were
told, &ldquo;but only on the understanding that you are amusing and instructive;
if you have no story to tell we shall yawn.&rdquo; When they comply with these
demands, artists are inclined to grow fond of sermonising and develop into
censors of the public morals, almost into lay preachers.</p>

<p>Or, if the aim of painting lies in its narrative power, there is a natural
tendency to represent the pleasant rather than the unpleasant facts of life,
which is the cause of this one-sided character of <i>genre</i> painting. Everything
that is not striking and out of the way&mdash;in other words, the whole poetry of
ordinary life&mdash;is left untouched. Wilkie only paints the rustic on some
peculiar occasion, at merry-making and ceremonial events; and he depicts
him as a being of a different species from the townsman, because he seeks to
gain his effects principally by humorous episodes, and aims at situations which
are proper to a novel.</p>

<p>Baptisms and dances,
funerals and weddings, carousals
and bridal visits are his
favourite subjects; to which
may be added the various
contrasts offered by peasant
life where it is brought into
contact with the civilisation
of cities&mdash;the country cousin
come to town, the rustic
closeted with a lawyer, and
the like. A continual roguishness
enlivens his pictures and
makes comical figures out of
most of these good people.
He amuses himself at their
expense, exposes their little
lies, their thrift, their folly,
their pretensions, and the absurdities
with which their
narrow circle of life has provided
them. He pokes fun,
and is sly and farcical. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>83</span>
the hard and sour labour of
ordinary peasant life is left
on one side, since it offers no
material for humour and
anecdote.</p>

<p>Through this limitation
painting renounced the best
part of its strength. To a
man of pictorial vision nature
is a gallery of magnificent
pictures, and one which is as
wide and far-reaching as the
world. But whoever seeks
salvation in narrative painting
soon reaches the end of
his material. In the life of
any man there are only three
or four events that are worth
the trouble of telling; Wilkie
told more, and he became
tiresome in consequence. We
are willing to accept these
anecdotes as true, but they
are threadbare. Things of
this sort may be found in
the gaily-bound little books
which are given as Christmas presents to children. It is not exhilarating
to learn that worldly marriages have their inconveniences, that there is a
pleasure in talking scandal about one&rsquo;s friends behind their backs, that a son
causes pain to his mother by his excesses, and that egoism is an unpleasant
failing. All that is true, but it is too true. We are irritated by the intrusiveness
of this course of instruction. Wilkie paints insipid subjects, and by
one foolery after another he has made painting into a toy for good children.
And good children play the principal parts in these pictures.</p>

<p>As a painter, one of George Morland&rsquo;s pupils, <i>William Collins</i>, threw the
world into ecstasies by his pictures of children. Out of one hundred and
twenty-one which he exhibited in the Academy in the course of forty years
the principal are: the picture of &ldquo;The Little Flute-Player,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Sale of the
Pet Lamb,&rdquo; &ldquo;Boys with a Bird&rsquo;s Nest,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Fisher&rsquo;s Departure,&rdquo; &ldquo;Scene
in a Kentish Hop-Garden,&rdquo; and the picture of the swallows. The most popular
were &ldquo;Happy as a King&rdquo;&mdash;a small boy whom his elder playmates have set
upon a garden railing, from which he looks down laughing proudly&mdash;and
&ldquo;Rustic Civility&rdquo;&mdash;children who have drawn up like soldiers, by a fence,
so as to salute some one who is approaching. But it is clear from the titles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>84</span>
of such pictures that in this province English <i>genre</i> painting did not free itself
from the reproach of being episodic. Collins was richer in ideas than Meyer
of Bremen. His children receive earrings, sit on their mother&rsquo;s knee, play
with her in the garden, watch her sewing, read aloud to her from their spelling-book,
learn their lessons, and are frightened of the geese and hens which
advance in a terrifying fashion towards them in the poultry-yard. He is an
admirable painter of children at the family table, of the pleasant chatter of
the little ones, of the father watching his sleeping child of an evening by
the light of the lamp, with his heart full of pride and joy because he
has the consciousness of working for those who are near to him. Being
naturally very fond of children, he has painted the life of little people
with evident enjoyment of all its variations, and yet not in a thoroughly
credible fashion. Chardin painted the poetry of the child-world. His little
ones have no suspicion of the painter being near them. They are harmlessly
occupied with themselves, and in their ordinary clothes. Those of
Collins look as if they were repeating a copybook maxim at a school
examination. They know that the eyes of all the sightseers in the exhibition
are fixed upon them, and they are doing their utmost to be on their best
behaviour. They have a lack of unconsciousness. One would like to say to
them: &ldquo;My dear children, always be good.&rdquo; But no one is grateful to the
painter for taking from children their childishness, and for bringing into
vogue that codling which had its way for so long afterwards in the pictures
of children.</p>

<p><i>Gilbert Stuart Newton</i>, an American by birth, who lived in England
from 1820 to 1835, devoted himself to the illustration of English authors.
Like Wilkie, he has a certain historical importance, because he devoted
himself with great zeal to a study of the Dutchmen of the seventeenth
century and to the French painters of the eighteenth, at a time when
these masters were entirely out of fashion on the Continent and sneered
at as representatives of &ldquo;the deepest corruption.&rdquo; Dow and Terborg
were his peculiar ideals; and although the colour of his pictures is
certainly heavy and common compared with that of his models, it is
artistic, and shows study when one thinks of contemporary productions
on the Continent. His works (&ldquo;Lear attended by Cordelia,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Vicar
of Wakefield restoring his Daughter to her Mother,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Prince of
Spain&rsquo;s Visit to Catalina&rdquo; from <i>Gil Blas</i>, and &ldquo;Yorick and the Grisette&rdquo;
from Sterne), like the pictures of the Düsseldorfers, would most certainly
have lost in actuality but for the interest provided by the literary
passages; yet they are favourably distinguished from the literary illustrations
of the Düsseldorfers by the want of any sort of idealism. While
the painters of the Continent in such pictures almost invariably fell into
a rounded, generalising ideal of beauty, Newton had the scene played
by actors and painted them realistically. The result was a theatrical
realism, but the way in which the theatrical effects are studied and the
palpableness of the histrionic gestures are so convincingly true to nature that
his pictures seem like records of stage art in London about the year 1830.</p>

<p><i>Charles Robert Leslie</i>, known as an author by his pleasant book on
Constable and a highly conservative <i>Handbook for Young Painters</i>, had a
similar <i>repértoire</i>, and rendered in oils Shakespeare, Cervantes, Fielding,
Sterne, Goldsmith, and Molière, with more or less ability. The National
Gallery has an exceedingly prosaic and colourless picture of his, &ldquo;Sancho
Panza in the Apartment of the Duchess.&rdquo; Some that are in the South
Kensington Museum are better; for example, &ldquo;The Taming of the Shrew,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Dinner at Mr. Page&rsquo;s House&rdquo; from <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i>,
and &ldquo;Sir Roger de Coverley.&rdquo; His finest and best-known work is &ldquo;My
Uncle Toby and the Widow Wadman,&rdquo; which charmingly illustrates the
pretty scene in <i>Tristram Shandy</i>: &ldquo;&rsquo;I protest, madam,&rsquo; said my Uncle
Toby, &lsquo;I can see nothing whatever in your eye.&rsquo; &lsquo;It is not in the white!&rsquo;
said Mrs. Wadman. My Uncle Toby looked with might and main into the
pupil.&rdquo; As in Newton&rsquo;s works, so in Leslie&rsquo;s too, there is such a strong dose
of realism that his pictures will always keep their value as historical documents&mdash;not
for the year 1630 but for 1830. As a colourist he was&mdash;in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>88</span>
later works at any rate&mdash;a
delicate imitator of the Dutch
<i>chiaroscuro</i>; and in the history
of art he occupies a position
similar to that of Diez in
Germany, and was esteemed
in the same way, even in
later years, when the young
Pre-Raphaelite school began
its embittered war against
&ldquo;brown sauce&rdquo;&mdash;the same
war which a generation afterwards
was waged in Germany
by Liebermann and his followers
against the school of
Diez.</p>

<p><i>Mulready</i>, thirty-two of
whose pictures are preserved
in the South Kensington
Museum, is in his technique
almost more delicate than
Leslie, and he has learnt a
great deal from Metsu. By
preference he took his subjects
out of Goldsmith. &ldquo;Choosing the Wedding Gown&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Whistonian Controversy&rdquo; would make pretty illustrations for an <i>édition de
luxe</i> of <i>The Vicar of Wakefield</i>. Otherwise he too had a taste for immortalising
children, by turns lazy and industrious, at their tea or playing by the
water&rsquo;s edge.</p>

<p>From <i>Thomas Webster</i>, the fourth of these kindly, childlike masters, yet
more inspiriting facts are to be obtained. He has informed the world that
at a not very remote period of English history all the agricultural labourers
were quite content with their lot. No one ever quarrelled with his landlord,
or sat in a public-house and let his family starve. The highest bliss of these
excellent people was to stay at home and play with their children by the
light of a wax-candle. Webster&rsquo;s rustics, children, and schoolmasters are
the citizens of an ideal planet, but the little country is a pleasant world. His
pictures are so harmless in intention, so neat and accurate in drawing, and
so clear and luminous in colour that they may be seen with pleasure even at
the present day.</p>

<p>The last of the group, <i>William Powell Frith</i>, was the most copious in
giving posterity information about the manners and costumes of his
contemporaries, and would be still more authentic if life had not seemed
to him so genial and roseate. His pictures represent scenes of the
nineteenth century, but they seem like events of the good old times.
At that period people were undoubtedly good and innocent and happy.
They had no income-tax and no vices and worries, and all went to
heaven and felt in good spirits. And so they do in Frith&rsquo;s pictures,
only not so naturally as in Ostade and Beham. For example, he goes
on the beach at a fashionable English watering-place during the season,
in July or August. The geniality which predominates here is quite
extraordinary. Children are splashing in the sea, young ladies flirting,
niggers playing the barrel-organ and women singing ballads to its
strains; every one is doing his utmost to look well, and the pair of
beggars who are there for the sake of contrast have long become
resigned to their fate. In his racecourse pictures everything is brought
together which on such occasions is representative of London life: all
types, from the baronet to the ragman; all beauties, from the lady to the
street-walker. A rustic has to lose his money, or a famished acrobat to
turn his pockets inside out to assure himself that there is really nothing
in them. His picture of the gaming-table in Homburg is almost richer in
such examples of dry observation and humorous and spirited episode.</p>

<p>This may serve to exemplify the failures of these painters of <i>genre</i>. Not
light and colour, but anecdote, comedy, and genial tale-telling are the basis of
their labours. And yet, notwithstanding
this attempt to
express literary ideas through
the mediums of a totally different
art, their work is significant.
While continental
artists avoided nothing so
much as that which might
seem to approach nature,
the English, revolting from
the thraldom of theory,
gathered subjects for their
pictures from actual life.
These men, indeed, pointed
out the way to painters from
every country; and they,
once on the right road, were
bound ultimately to arrive
at the point from which
they no longer looked on
life through the glasses of
the anecdotist, but saw it
with the eye of the true
artist.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">While</span> English painting from the days of Hogarth and Wilkie embraced
rustic and middle-class life, the victory of modernity on the Continent
could only be accomplished slowly and by degrees. The question of costume
played an important part in it. &ldquo;Artists love antiquated costume because,
as they say, it gives them greater sweep and freedom. But I should like to
suggest that in historical representations of their own age an eye should be
kept on propriety of delineation rather than on freedom and sweep. Otherwise
one might just as well allow an historian to talk to us about phalanxes,
battlements, triarii, and argyraspids in place of battalions, squadrons, grenadiers,
and cuirassiers. The painters of the great events of the day ought, especially,
to be more true to fact. In battle-pieces, for example, they ought not to
have cavalry shooting and sabreing about them in leather collars, in round
and plumed hats, and the vast jack-boots which exist no longer. The old
masters drew, engraved, and painted in this way because people really dressed
in such a manner at the time. It is said that our costume is not picturesque,
and therefore why should we choose it? But posterity will be curious to know
how we clothed ourselves, and will wish to have no gap from the eighteenth
century to its own time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These words, which the well-known Vienna librarian Denis wrote in 1797
in his <i>Lesefrüchte</i>, show how early came the problem which was at high-water
mark for a generation afterwards. The painting of the nineteenth century
could only become modern when it succeeded in recognising and expressing
the characteristic side of modern costume. But to do that it took more than
half a century. It was, after all, natural that to people who had seen the
graceful forms and delicate colours of the <i>rococo</i> time, the garb of the first
half of the century should seem the most unfortunate and the least enviable
in the whole history of costume. &ldquo;What person of artistic education is
not of the opinion,&rdquo; runs a passage in Putmann&rsquo;s book on the Düsseldorf
school in 1835,&mdash;&ldquo;what person of artistic education is not of the opinion
that the dress of the present day is tasteless, hideous, and ape-like? Moreover,
can a true style be brought into harmony with hoop-petticoats and
swallow-tail coats and such vagaries? In our time, therefore, art is right
in seeking out those beautiful fashions of the past, about which tailors concern
themselves so little. How much longer must we go about, unpicturesque
beings, like ugly black bats,
in swallow-tail coats and
wide trousers? The peasant&rsquo;s
blouse, indeed, can be
accepted as one of the few
picturesque dresses which
have yet been preserved in
Germany from the inauspicious
influence of the times.&rdquo;
The same plaint is sung by
Hotho in his history of
German and Netherlandish
painting; the costume of
his age he declares to be
thoroughly prosaic and tiresome.
It is revolting to
painters and an offence to
the educated eye. Art must
necessarily seek salvation in
the past, unless it is to
wait, and give brush and
palette a holiday, until that
happy time when the costume
of nations comes to its
pictorial regeneration. Only
one zone, the realm of
blouse and military uniform,
was beyond the domain of tail-coat and trousers, and still furnished art
with rich material.</p>

<p>Since it was by working on uniform that plastic artists first learnt how
to treat contemporary costume, so it was the military picture that first entered
the circle of modern painting. By exalting the soldier into a warrior, and
the warrior into a hero, it was here possible, even in the times of David and
Carstens, to effect a certain compromise with the ruling classical ideas. Gérard,
Girodet&mdash;to some extent even Gros&mdash;made abundant use of the mask of the
Greek or Roman warrior, with the object of admitting the battle-piece into
painting in the grand style. The real heroes of the Napoleonic epoch had
not this plastic appearance nor these epic attitudes. Classicism altered their
physiognomies and gave them, most illogically, the air of old marble statues.
It was Horace Vernet who freed battle painting from this anathema. This,
but little else, stands to his credit.</p>

<p>Together with his son-in-law Paul Delaroche, <i>Horace Vernet</i> is the most
genuine product of the <i>Juste-milieu</i> period. The king with the umbrella
founded the Museum of Versailles, that monstrous depôt of daubed canvas,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>96</span>
which is a horrifying memory to any one who has ever wandered through it.
However, it is devoted <i>à toutes les gloires de la France</i>. In a few years a suite
of galleries, which it takes almost two hours merely to pass through from end
to end, was filled with pictures of all sizes, bringing home the history of the
country, from Charlemagne to the African expedition of Louis Philippe, under
all circumstances which are in any way flattering to French pride. For miles
numberless manufacturers of painting bluster from the walls. As <i>pictor
celerrimus</i> Horace Vernet had the command-in-chief, and became so famous
by his chronicle of the conquest of Algiers that for a long time he was held
by trooper, Philistine, and all the kings and emperors of Europe as the greatest
painter in France. He was the last scion of a celebrated dynasty of artists,
and had taken a brush in his hand from the moment he threw away his child&rsquo;s
rattle. A good deal of talent had been given him in his cradle: sureness of
eye, lightness of hand, and an enviable memory. His vision was correct, if
not profound; he painted his pictures without hesitation, and is favourably
distinguished from many of his contemporaries by his independence: he owes
no one anything, and reveals his own qualities without arraying himself in
those of other people. Only these qualities are not of an order which gives
his pictures artistic interest. The spark
of Géricault&rsquo;s genius, which seems to have
been transmitted to him in the beginning,
was completely quenched in his later years.
Having swiftly attained popularity by the
aid of lithography which circulated his
&ldquo;Mazeppa&rdquo; through the whole world,
he became afterwards a bad and vulgar
painter, without poetry, light, or colour;
a reporter who expressed himself in banal
prose and wounded all the finer spirits of
his age. &ldquo;I loathe this man,&rdquo; said Baudelaire,
as early as 1846.</p>

<p>Devoid of any sense of the tragedy of
war, which Gros possessed in such a high
degree, Vernet treated battles like performances
at the circus. His pictures
have movement without passion, and
magnitude without greatness. If it had
been required of him, he would have
daubed all the boulevards; his picture of
Smala is certainly not so long, but there
would have been no serious difficulty in
lengthening it by half a mile. This
incredible stenographical talent won for
him his popularity. He was decorated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>97</span>
with all the orders in the world. The <i>bourgeois</i> felt happy when he looked
at Vernet&rsquo;s pictures, and the paterfamilias promised to buy a horse for his
little boy. The soldiers called him &ldquo;<i>mon colonel</i>,&rdquo; and would not have been
surprised if he had been made a Marshal of France. A lover of art passes
the pictures of Vernet with the sentiment which the old colonel owned to
entertaining towards music. &ldquo;Are you fond of music, colonel?&rdquo; asked a
lady. &ldquo;Madame, I am not afraid of it.&rdquo;</p>

<td class="tcr f80 pb2">THE PARADE.</td></tr></table>

<p>The trivial realism of his workmanship is as tedious as the unreal heroism
of his soldiers. In the manner in which he conceived the trooper, Vernet
stands between the Classicists and the moderns. He did not paint ancient
warriors, but French soldiers: he knew them as a corporal knows his men,
and by this respect for prescribed regulation he was prevented from turning
them into Romans. But though he disregarded Classicism, in outward
appearance, he did not drop the heroic tone. He always saw the soldier as
the bold defender of his country, the warrior performing daring deeds, as in
the &ldquo;Battle of Alexander&rdquo;; and in this way he gave his pictures their
unpleasant air of bluster. For neither modern tactics nor modern cannon
admit of the prominence of the individual as it is to be seen in Vernet&rsquo;s pictures.
The soldier of the nineteenth century is no longer a warrior, but the unit in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>98</span>
multitude; he does what he is ordered, and for that he has no need of the
spirit of an ancient hero; he kills or is killed, without seeing his enemy or being
seen himself. The course of a battle advances, move by move, according
to mathematical calculation. It is therefore false to represent soldiers in
heroic attitudes, or even to suggest deeds of heroism on the part of those in
command. In giving his orders and directing a battle a general has to behave
pretty much as he does at home at his writing-table. And he is never in the
battle, as he is represented by Horace Vernet; on the contrary, he remains
at a considerable distance off. Therefore, even with the dimensions of which
Vernet availed himself, the exact portrait of a modern battle is exclusively
an affair for panorama, but never for the flat surface of a picture. A picture
must confine itself, either to the field-marshal directing the battle from a
distance upon a hill in the midst of his staff, or else to little pictorial episodes
in the individual life of the soldier. The gradual development from unreal
battle-pieces to simple episodic paintings can be followed step by step in the
following works.</p>

<p>What was painted for the Versailles Museum in connection with deeds
of arms in the Crimean War and the Italian campaign kept more or less to the
blustering official style of Horace Vernet. In the galleries of Versailles the
battles of Wagram, Loano, and Altenkirche (1837-39), and an episode from
the retreat from Russia (1851), represent the work of <i>Hippolyte Bellangé</i>.
These are huge lithochromes which have been very carefully executed. <i>Adolphe</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>99</span>
<i>Yvon</i>, who is responsible for &ldquo;The Taking of Malakoff,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Battle of
Magenta,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Battle of Solferino,&rdquo; is a more tedious painter, and
remained during his whole life a pupil of Delaroche; he laid chief stress on
finished and rounded composition, and gave his soldiers no more appearance
of life than could be forced into the accepted academic convention. The
fame of <i>Isidor Pils</i>, who immortalised the disembarkation of the French troops
in the Crimea, the battle of Alma, and the reception of Arab chiefs by Napoleon
III, has paled with equal rapidity. He could paint soldiers, but not battles,
and, like Yvon, he was too precise in the composition of his works. In consequence
they have as laboured an effect in arrangement as they have in
colour. He was completely wanting in sureness and spontaneity. It is only his
water-colours that hold one&rsquo;s attention; and this they do at any rate by their
unaffected actuality, and in spite of their dull and heavy colour. <i>Alexandre
Protais</i> verged more on the sentimental. He loved soldiers, and therefore
had the less toleration for war, which swept the handsome young fellows
away. Two pendants, &ldquo;The Morning before the Attack&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Evening
after the Battle,&rdquo; founded his reputation in 1863. The first showed a group
of riflemen waiting in excitement for the first bullets of the enemy; the second
represented the same men in the evening delighted with their victory,
but at the same time&mdash;and here you have the note of Protais&mdash;mournful
over the loss of their comrades. &ldquo;The Prisoners&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Parting&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>100</span>
of 1872 owed their success to the same lachrymose and melodramatic
sensibility.</p>

<p class="pt2">A couple of mere lithographists, soldiers&rsquo; sons, in whom a repining for the
Napoleonic legend still found its echo, were the first great military painters
of modern France. &ldquo;Charlet and Raffet,&rdquo; wrote Bürger-Thoré in his <i>Salon</i>
of 1845, &ldquo;are the two artists who best understand the representation of that
almost vanished type, the trooper of the Empire; and after Gros they will
assuredly endure as the principal historians of that warlike era.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Charlet</i>, the painter of the old bear Napoleon <span class="sc">I</span>, might almost be called
the Béranger of painting. The &ldquo;little Corporal,&rdquo; the &ldquo;great Emperor&rdquo;
appears and reappears in his pictures and drawings without intermission;
his work is an epic in pencil of the grey coat and the little hat. From his
youth he employed himself with military studies, which were furthered in
Gros&rsquo; studio, which he entered in 1817. The Græco-Roman ideal did not
exist for him, and he was indifferent to beauty of form. His was one of those
natures which have a natural turn for actual fact; he had a power for characterisation,
and in his many water-colours and lithographs he was merely concerned
with the proper expression of his ideas. How it came that Delacroix
had so great a respect for him was nevertheless explained when his &ldquo;Episode
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>101</span>
in the Retreat from Russia,&rdquo; in the World Exhibition of 1889, emerged from
the obscurity of the Lyons Museum; it is perhaps his best and most important
picture. When it appeared in the Salon of 1836, Alfred de Musset wrote
that it was &ldquo;not an episode but a complete poem&rdquo;; he went on to say that
the artist had painted &ldquo;the despair in the wilderness,&rdquo; and that, with its
gloomy heaven and disconsolate horizon, the picture gave the impression of
infinite disaster. After fifty years it had lost none of its value. Since the
reappearance of this picture it has been recognised that Charlet was not
merely the specialist of old grey heads with their noses reddened with brandy,
the Molière of barracks and canteens, but that he understood all the tragical
sublimity of war, from which Horace Vernet merely produced trivial anecdotes.</p>

<p>Beside him stands his pupil <i>Raffet</i>, the special painter of the <i>grande armée</i>.
He mastered the brilliant figure of Napoleon; he followed it from Ajaccio to
St. Helena, and never left it until he had said everything that was to be said
about it. He showed the &ldquo;little Corsican&rdquo; as the general of the Italian
campaign, ghastly pale and consumed with ambition; the Bonaparte of the
Pyramids and of Cairo; the Emperor Napoleon on the parade-ground reviewing
his Grenadiers; the triumphal hero of 1807 with the Cuirassiers dashing past,
brandishing their sabres with a hurrah; the Titan of Beresina riding slowly
over the waste of snow, and, in the very midst of disaster, spying a new star
of fortune; the war-god of 1813, the great hypnotiser greeted even by the
dying with a cry of &ldquo;Long life
to the Emperor&rdquo;; the adventurer
of 1814, riding at the head
of shattered troops over a barren
wilderness; the vanquished hero
of 1815, who, in the midst of his
last square, in the thick of his
beloved battalions, calls fickle fate
once more into the lists; and the
captive lion who, from the bridge
of the ship, casts a last look on
the coast of France as it fades
in the mist. He has called the
Emperor from the grave, as a
ghostly power, to hold a midnight
review of the <i>grande armée</i>.
And with love and passion and
enthusiasm he has followed the
instrument of these victories, the
French soldiers, the swordsmen
of seven years&rsquo; service, through
bivouac and battle, on the march
and on parade, as patrols and outposts.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>102</span>
The ragged and shoeless troops of the Empire are portrayed in his
plates, with a touch of real sublimity, in defeat and in victory. The empty
inflated expression of martial enthusiasm has been avoided by him; everything
is true and earnest.</p>

<p>In a masterly fashion he could make soldiers deploy in masses. No one
has known in the same way how to render the impression of the multitude
of an army, the notion of men standing shoulder to shoulder, the welding of
thousands of individuals into one complete entity. In Raffet a regiment
is a thousand-headed living being that has but one soul, one moral nature,
one spirit, one sentiment of willing sacrifice and heroic courage. His death
was as adventurous as his life; he passed away in a hotel in Genoa, and was
brought back to French soil as part of the cargo of a merchant ship. For a
long time his fame was thrown into the shade, at first by the triumphs of
Horace Vernet, and then by those of Meissonier, until at length a fitting record
was devoted to him by the piety of his son Auguste.</p>

<p>Never had <i>Ernest Meissonier</i> to complain of want of recognition. After
his <i>rococo</i> pictures had been deemed worth their weight in gold he climbed
to the summit of his fame, his universal celebrity and his popularity in France,
when he devoted himself in the sixties to the representation of French military
history. The year 1859 took him to Italy in the train of Napoleon <span class="sc">III</span>.
Meissonier was chosen to spread the martial glory of the Emperor, and, as
the nephew was fond of drawing parallels between himself and his mighty
uncle, Meissonier was obliged to depict suitable occasions from the life of the
first Napoleon. His admirers were very curious to know how the great &ldquo;little
painter&rdquo; would acquit himself in such a monumental task. First came the
&ldquo;Battle of Solferino,&rdquo; that picture of the Musée Luxembourg which represents
Napoleon <span class="sc">III</span> overlooking the battle from a height in the midst of his staff.
After lengthy preparations it appeared in the Salon of 1864, and showed
that the painter had not been untrue to himself: he had simply adapted the
minute technique of his <i>rococo</i> pictures to the painting of war, and he remained
the Dutch &ldquo;little master&rdquo; in all the battle-pieces which followed.</p>

<p>Napoleon <span class="sc">III</span> had no further deeds of arms to record, so the intended
parallel series was never accomplished. It is true, indeed, that he took the
painter with the army in 1870; but after the first battle was lost, Meissonier
went home: he did not wish to immortalise the struggles of a retreat. Henceforward
his brush was consecrated to the first Napoleon. &ldquo;1805&rdquo; depicts
the triumphant advance to the height of fame; &ldquo;1807&rdquo; shows Napoleon
when the summit has been reached and the soldiers are cheering their idol
in exultation; &ldquo;1814&rdquo; represents the fall: the star of fortune has vanished;
victory, so long faithful to the man of might, has deserted his banners. There
is still a look of indomitable energy on the pale face of the Emperor, as, in
utter despair, he aims his last shot against the traitor destiny; but his eyes
seem weary, his mouth is contorted, and his features are wasted with fever.</p>

<p>Meissonier has treated all these works with the carefulness which he expended
on his little <i>rococo</i>
pictures. To give an historically
accurate representation of
Napoleon&rsquo;s boots he did not
content himself with borrowing
them from the museum. Walking
and riding&mdash;for he was a
passionate horseman&mdash;he wore
for months together boots of the
same make and form as those of
the &ldquo;little Corporal.&rdquo; To get
the colour of the horses of the
Emperor and his marshals, in
their full-grown winter coat, and
to paint them just as they must
have appeared after the hardships
and negligence of a campaign,
he bought animals of the
same race and colour as those
ridden by the Emperor and his
generals, according to tradition,
and picketed them for weeks in
the snow and rain. His models
were forced to wear out the uniforms
in sun and storm before
he painted them; he bought weapons and harness at fancy prices when
he could not borrow them from museums. And there is no need to say that
he copied all the portraits of Napoleon, Ney, Soult, and the other generals
that were to be had, and read through whole libraries before beginning his
Napoleon series. To paint the picture &ldquo;1814,&rdquo; which is generally reckoned
his greatest performance&mdash;Napoleon at the head of his staff riding through a
snow-clad landscape&mdash;he first prepared the scenery on a spot in the plain
of Champagne, corresponding to the original locality, just as he did in earlier
years with his interiors of the <i>rococo</i> period; he even had the road laid out
on which he wished to paint the Emperor advancing. Then he waited for
the first fall of snow, and had artillery, cavalry, and infantry to march for
him upon this snowy path, and actually contrived that overturned transport
waggons, discarded arms, and baggage should be decoratively strewn about
the landscape.</p>

<p>From these laborious preparations it may be understood that he spent
almost as many millions of francs upon his pictures as he received. In his
article, <i>What an Old Work of Art is Worth</i>, Julius Lessing has admirably dealt
with the hidden ways of taste and commerce applied to art. Amongst all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>106</span>
painters of modern times Meissonier is the only one whose pictures, during
his own lifetime, fetched prices such as are only reached by the works of famous
old masters of the greatest epochs. And yet he sold them straight from his
easel, and never to dealers. Meissonier avenged himself magnificently for
the privations of his youth. In 1832, when he gave up his apprenticeship
with Menier, the great chocolate manufacturer, to become a painter, he had
fifteen francs a month to spend. He had great difficulty in disposing of his
drawings and illustrations for five or ten francs, and was often obliged to
console himself with a roll for the want of a dinner. Only ten years later he
was able to purchase a small place in Poissy, near St. Germain, where he went
for good in 1850, to give himself up to work without interruption. Gradually
this little property became a pleasant country seat, and in due course of time
the stately house in Paris, in the Boulevard Malesherbes, was added to it.
His &ldquo;Napoleon, 1814,&rdquo; for which the painter himself received three hundred
thousand francs, was bought at an auction by one of the owners of the &ldquo;Grands
Magasins du Louvre&rdquo; for eight hundred and fifty thousand francs; &ldquo;Napoleon
III at Solferino&rdquo; brought him two hundred thousand, and &ldquo;The Charge of
the Cuirassiers&rdquo; three hundred thousand. And in general, after 1850, he
only painted for such sums. It was calculated that he received about five
thousand francs for every centimetre of painted canvas, and left behind him
pictures which, according to present rate, were worth more than twenty
million francs, without having really become a rich man; for, as a rule, every
picture that he painted cost him several thousand.</p>

<p>And Meissonier never sacrificed himself to money-making and the trade.
He never put a stroke on paper without the conviction that he could not make
it better, and for this artistic earnestness he was universally honoured, even
by his colleagues, to his very death. As master beyond dispute he let the
Classicists, Romanticists, Impressionists, and Symbolists pass by the window
of his lonely studio, and always remained the same. A little man with a firm
step, an energetic figure, eyes that shone like coals, thick, closely cropped
hair, and the beard of a river-god, that always seemed to grow longer, at
eighty years of age he was as hale and active as at thirty. By a systematic
routine of life he kept his physique elastic, and was able to maintain that
unintermittent activity under which another man would have broken down.
During long years Meissonier went to rest at eight every evening, slept till
midnight, and then worked at his drawings by lamplight into the morning.
In the course of the day he made his studies from nature and painted. Diffident
in society and hard of access, he did not permit himself to be disturbed
in his indefatigable diligence by any social demands. A sharp ride, a swim or
a row was his only relaxation. In 1848, as captain of the National Guard, he
had taken part in the street and barricade fighting; and again in 1871, when
he was sixty-six, he clattered through the streets of the capital, with the
dangling sword he had so often painted and a gold-laced cap stuck jauntily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>107</span>
on one side, as a smart staff-officer. Even the works of his old age showed no
exhaustion of power, and there is something great in attaining ripe years
without outliving one&rsquo;s reputation. As late as the spring of 1890, only a
short time before his death, he was the leader of youth, when it transmigrated
from the Palais des Champs Elysées to the Champ de Mars; and he exhibited
in this new Salon his &ldquo;October 1806,&rdquo; with which he closed his Napoleonic
epic and his general activity as a painter. Halting on a hill, the Emperor in
his historical grey coat, mounted on a powerful grey, is thoughtfully watching
the course of the battle, without troubling himself about the Cuirassiers who
salute him exultantly as they storm by, or about the brilliant staff which
has taken up position behind him. Not a feature moves in the sallow, cameo-like
face of the Corsican. The sky is lowering and full of clouds. In the
foreground lie a couple of dead soldiers, in whose uniform every button has
been painted with the same conscientious care that was bestowed on the
buttons of the <i>rococo</i> coats of fifty years before.</p>

<p>Beyond this inexhaustible correctness I can really see nothing that can
be said for Meissonier&rsquo;s fame as an artist. He, whose name is honoured
in both hemispheres, was most peculiarly the son of his own work. The
genius for the infinitesimal has never been carried further. He knew everything
that a man can learn. The movements in his pictures are correct,
the physiognomies interesting, the delicacy of execution indescribable,
and his horses have been so exactly studied that they stand the test of
instantaneous photography. But painter,
in the proper sense, he never was. Precisely
through their marvellous minuteness
of execution&mdash;a minuteness which is
merely attractive as a trial of patience and
as an example of what the brush can
do&mdash;his pictures are wanting in unity
of conception, and they leave one
cold by the hardness of their contours,
the aridness of their colour, and the absence
of all vibrating, nervous feeling. In
a cavalry charge, with the whirling dust
and the snorting horses, who thinks of
costume? And who thinks of anything
else when Meissonier paints a charge?
Here are life and movement, and there
a museum of military uniforms. When
Manet saw Meissonier&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cuirassiers&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;Everything is iron here except the
cuirasses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His <i>rococo</i> pictures are probably his best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>108</span>
performances; they even express a certain amount of temperament.
His military pictures make one chilly. Reproduced in woodcuts they
are good illustrations for historical works, but as pictures they repel
the eye, because they lack air and light and spirit. They rouse nothing
except astonishment at the patience and incredible industry that went
to the making of them. One sees everything in them&mdash;everything that
the painter can have seen&mdash;to the slightest detail; only one does not
rightly come into contact with the artist himself. His battle-pieces stand
high above the scenic pictures of Horace Vernet and Hippolyte Bellangé, but
they have nothing of the warmth of Raffet or the vibrating life of Neuville.
There is nothing in them that is contagious and carries one away, or that
appeals to the heart. Patience is a virtue: genius is a gift. Precious without
originality, intelligent without imagination, dexterous without verve, elegant
without charm, refined and subtile without delicacy, Meissonier has all the
qualities that interest, and none of those which lay hold of one. He was a
painter of a distinctness which causes astonishment, but not admiration; an
artist for epicures, but for those of the second order, who pay the more highly
for works of art in proportion as they value their artifice. His pictures recall
the unseasonable compliment which Charles Blanc made to Ingres: &ldquo;<i>Cher
maître, vous avez deviné la photographie trente ans avant qu&rsquo;il y eut des photographes.</i>&rdquo;
Or else one thinks of that malicious story of which Jules Dupré is
well known as the author. &ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that you are a great personage
who has just bought a Meissonier. Your valet enters the salon where it
is hanging. &lsquo;Ah! Monsieur,&rsquo; he cries, &lsquo;what a beautiful picture you have
bought! That is a masterpiece!&rsquo; Another time you buy a Rembrandt,
and show it to your valet, in the expectation that he will at any rate be
overcome by the same raptures. <i>Mais non!</i> This time the man looks
embarrassed. &lsquo;Ah! Monsieur,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;<i>il faut s&rsquo;y connaître</i>,&rsquo; and away
he goes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Guillaume Regamey</i>, who is far less known, supplies what is wanting in
Meissonier. Sketchy and of a highly strung nervous temperament, he could
not adapt himself to the picture-market; but the history of art honours him
as the most spirited draughtsman of the French soldier, after Géricault and
Raffet. He did not paint him turned out for parade, ironed and smartened
up, but in the worst trim. Syria, the Crimea, Italy, and the East are mingled
with the difference of their types and the brightness of their exotic costumes.
He had a great love for the catlike, quick-glancing chivalry of Turcos and
Sapphis; but especially he loved the cavalry. His &ldquo;Chasseurs d&rsquo;Afrique&rdquo;
are part and parcel of their horses, like centaurs, and many of his cavalry
groups recall the frieze of the Parthenon. Unfortunately he died at thirty-eight,
shortly before the war of 1870, the historians of which were the younger
painters, who had grown up in the shadow of Meissonier.</p>

<p>The most important of the group, <i>Alphonse de Neuville</i>, had looked at war
very closely as an officer during the siege of Paris, and in this way he made
himself a fine illustrator, who in his anecdotic pictures specially understood
the secret of painting powder-smoke and the vehemence of a fusillade. The
&ldquo;Bivouac before Le Bourget&rdquo; brought him his first success. &ldquo;The Last
Cartridges,&rdquo; &ldquo;Le Bourget,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Graveyard of Saint-Privat&rdquo; made
him a popular master. Neuville is peculiarly the French painter of fighting.
He did not know, as Charlet did, the soldier in time of peace, the peasant lad
of yesterday who only cares about his stomach and has little taste for martial
adventure. His soldier is an elegant and enthusiastic youthful hero. He
even neglected the troops of the line; his preference was for the Chasseur,
whose cap is stuck jauntily on his head and whose trousers fall better. He
loved the plumes, the high boots of the officers, the sword-knots, canes, and
eye-glasses. Everything received grace from his dexterous hand; he even
saw in the trooper a gallant and ornamental <i>bibelot</i>, which he painted with
chivalrous verve.</p>

<p>The pictures of Aimé Morot, the painter of &ldquo;The Charge of the Cuirassiers,&rdquo;
possibly smell most of powder. Neuville&rsquo;s frequently over-praised rival,
Meissonier&rsquo;s favourite pupil, <i>Edouard Détaille</i>, after he had started with pretty
little costume pictures from the <i>Directoire</i> period, went further on the way of
his teacher with less laboriousness and more lightness, with less calculation
and more sincerity. The best of his works was &ldquo;Salut aux Blessés&rdquo;&mdash;the
representation of a troop of wounded Prussian officers and soldiers on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>112</span>
country road, passing a French general and his staff, who with graceful
chivalry lift their caps and salute the wounded men. Détaille&rsquo;s great
pictures, such as &ldquo;The Presentation of the Colours,&rdquo; and his panoramas
were as accurate as they were tedious and arid, although they are far
superior to most of the efforts which the Germans made to depict scenes
from the war of 1870.</p>

<p>In Germany the great period of the wars of liberation first inspired a group
of painters with the courage to enter the province of battle-painting, which
had been so much despised by their classical colleagues. Germany had been
turned into a great camp. Prussian, French, Austrian, Russian, and Bavarian
troops passed in succession through the towns and villages: long trains of
cannon and transport waggons came in their wake, and friends and foes were
billeted amongst the inhabitants; the Napoleonic epoch was enacted. Such
scenes followed each other like the gay slides in a magic lantern, and once
more gave to some among the younger generation eyes for the outer world.
There was awakened in them the capacity for receiving impressions of reality
and transferring them swiftly to paper. Two hundred years before, the emancipation
of Dutch art from the Italian house of bondage had been accomplished
in precisely the same fashion. The Dutch struggle for freedom and
the Thirty Years&rsquo; War had filled Holland with numbers of soldiery. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>113</span>
doings of these mercenaries, daily enacted before them in rich costume and
with manifold brightness, riveted the pictorial feeling of artists. Echoes of
war, fighting scenes, skirmishes and tumult, the incidents of camp life, arming,
billeting, and marauding episodes are the first independent products of the
Dutch school. Then the more peaceable doings of soldiers are represented.
At Haarlem, in the neighbourhood of Frans Hals, were assembled the painters
of social pieces, as they are called; pieces in which soldiers, bold and rollicking
officers, make merry with gay maidens at wine and play and love. From
thence the artist came to the portrayal of a peasantry passing their time in
the same rough, free and easy life, and thence onward to the representation
of society in towns.</p>

<p>German painting in the nineteenth century took the same road. Eighty
years ago foreign troops, and the extravagantly &ldquo;picturesque and often
ragged uniforms of the Republican army, the characteristic and often wild
physiognomies of the French soldiers,&rdquo; gave artists their first fresh and
variously hued impressions. Painters of military subjects make their studies,
not in the antiquity class of the academy, but upon the parade-ground and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>114</span>
in the camp. Later, when the warlike times were over, they passed from
the portrayal of soldiers to that of rustics; and so they laid the foundation
on which future artists built.</p>

<p>In Berlin Franz Krüger and in Munich Albrecht Adam and Peter Hess
were figures of individual character, belonging to the spiritual family of
Chodowiecki and Gottfried Schadow; and, entirely undisturbed by classical
theories or romantic reverie, they penetrated the life around them
with a clear and sharp glance. They lacked, indeed, the temperament to
comprehend either the high poetic tendencies of the old Munich school or the
sentimental enthusiasm of the old Düsseldorf.</p>

<p>On the other hand, they were unhackneyed artists, facing facts in a completely
unprejudiced spirit: entirely self-reliant, they refused to form themselves
upon any model derived from the old masters; they had never had a
teacher and never enjoyed academic instruction. This naïve straightforwardness
makes their painting a half-barbaric product; something which has
been allowed to run wild. But in a period of archæological resuscitations,
pedantic brooding over the past and slavish imitation of the ancients, it seems,
for this very reason, the first independent product of the nineteenth century.
As vigorous, matter-of-fact realists they know nothing of more delicate charms,
but represented fact for all it was worth and as honestly and conscientiously
as was humanly possible. They are lacking in the distinctively pictorial
character, but they are absolutely untouched by the Classicism of the epoch.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>115</span>
They never dream of putting the uniforms of their warriors upon antique
statues. It is this downright honesty that renders their pictures not merely
irreplaceable as documents for the history of civilisation, and in spite of their
unexampled frigidity, hardness, and gaudiness, lends them, even from the
standpoint of art, a certain innovating quality. In a pleasantly written
autobiography <i>Albrecht Adam</i> has himself described the drift of historical
events which made him a painter of battles.</p>

<p>He was a confectioner&rsquo;s apprentice in Nördlingen when, in the year 1800,
the marches of the French army began in the neighbourhood. In an inn he
began to sketch sergeants and Grenadiers, and went proudly home with the
pence that he earned in this way. &ldquo;Adam, when there&rsquo;s war, I&rsquo;ll take you
into the field with me,&rdquo; said an old major-general, who was the purchaser
of his first works. That came to pass in 1809, when the Bavarians went with
Napoleon against Austria. After a few weeks he was in the thick of raging
battle. He saw Napoleon, the Crown-Prince Ludwig, and General Wrede,
was present at the battles of Abensberg, Eckmühl, and Wagram, and came
to Vienna with his portfolios full of sketches. There his portraits and pictures
of the war found favour with the officers, and Eugène Beauharnais, Viceroy
of Italy, took him to Upper Italy and afterwards to Russia. He was an eye-witness
of the battles at Borodino and on the Moskwa, and saved himself
from the conflagration of Moscow by his courage and determination. A true
soldier, he mounted a horse when he was sixty-two years of age to be present
on the Italian expedition of the Austrian army under Radetzky in 1848. His
battle-pieces are therefore the result of personal experience. When campaigning
he led the same life as the soldiers whom he portrayed, and as he proceeded
in this portrayal with the objective quietness and fidelity of an historian,
his artistic productions are invaluable as documents. Even where he could
not draw as an eye-witness he invariably made studies afterwards, endeavouring
to collect the most reliable material upon the spot, and preparing it with
the utmost conscientiousness. The ground occupied by bodies of troops, the
marshalling of them, and the conflict of masses, together with the smallest
episodes, are represented with simplicity and reality. In the portrayal of
the soldier&rsquo;s life in time of peace he was inexhaustible. Just as vividly could
he render horses undergoing the strain of the march and in the tumult of
battle as in the stall, the farm-horse of the transport waggon no less than the
noble creature ridden for parade. That his colour was sharp and hard, and
his pictures therefore devoid of harmony, is to be explained by the helplessness
of the age in regard to colouring. Only his last pictures, such as &ldquo;The Battle
on the Moskwa,&rdquo; have a certain harmony of hue; and there is no doubt that
this is to be set to the account of his son Franz.</p>

<p>After Adam, the father of German battle-painters, <i>Peter Hess</i> made an
epoch by the earnestness and actuality of his pictures. He too accompanied
General Wrede on the 1813-15 campaigns, and has left behind him exceedingly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>116</span>
healthy, sane, and objectively viewed Cossack scenes, bivouacs, and the like,
belonging to this period; though in his great pictures he aimed at totality
of effect just as little as Adam. Confused by the complexity of his material,
he only ventured to single out individual incidents, and then put them together
on the canvas after the fashion of a mosaic; and, to make the nature of the
action as clear as possible, he assumed as his standpoint the perspective view
of a bird. Of course, pictures produced in this way make an effect which
is artistically childish, but as the primitive endeavours of modern German
art they will keep their place. The best known of his pictures are those inspired
by the choice of Prince Otto of Bavaria as King of Greece, especially
&ldquo;The Reception of King Otto in Nauplia,&rdquo; which is to be found in the new
Pinakothek in Munich. In spite of its hard, motley, and quite impossible
colouring, and its petty pedantry of execution, this is a picture which will
not lose its value as an historical source.</p>

<p>Vigorous <i>Franz Krüger</i> had been long known in Berlin, by his famous
pictures of horses, before the Emperor of Russia in 1829 commissioned him
to paint, on a huge canvas, the great parade on the <i>Opernplatz</i> in Berlin, where
he had reviewed his regiment of Cuirassiers before the King of Prussia. From
that time such parade pictures became Krüger&rsquo;s specialty; especially famous
is the great parade of 1839, with the likenesses of those who at the time played
a political or literary part in Berlin. In these works he has left a true reflection
of old Berlin, and bridged over the chasm between Chodowiecki and Menzel:
this is specially the case with his curiously objective water-colour portrait
heads. Mention should be made of Karl Steffeck as a pupil of Krüger, and
Theodor Horschelt&mdash;in addition to Franz Adam&mdash;as a pupil of Adam. By
<i>Steffeck</i>, a healthy, vigorous realist, there are some well-painted portraits
of horses, and by <i>Th. Horschelt</i>, who in 1858 took part in the fights of the
Russians against the Circassians in the Caucasus, there survive some of the
spirited and masterly pen-and-ink sketches which he published collectively
in his <i>Memories from the Caucasus</i>. <i>Franz Adam</i>, who first published a
collection of lithographs on the Italian campaign of 1848 in connection with
Raffet, and in the Italian war of 1859 painted his first masterpiece, a scene
from the battle of Solferino, owes his finest successes&mdash;although he had taken
no part in it&mdash;to the war of 1870. In respect of harmony of colouring he is
perhaps the finest painter of battle-pieces Germany has produced. As I
shall later have no opportunity of doing so, I must mention here the works
of <i>Josef Brandt</i>, the best of Franz Adam&rsquo;s pupils. They are painted with
verve and chivalrous feeling. There is a flame and a sparkle, both in the
forms of his warriors and of his horses, in his pictures of old Polish cavalry
battles. Everything is aristocratic: the distinction of the grey colouring no
less than the ductile drawing with its chivalrous sentiment. In everything
there breathes life, vigour, fire, and freshness: the East of Eugène Fromentin
translated into Polish. <i>Heinrich Lang</i>, a spirited draughtsman, who had the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>117</span>
art of seizing the most difficult positions and motions of a horse, embodied
the wild tumult of cavalry charges (&ldquo;The Charge of the Bredow Brigade,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Charge at Floing,&rdquo; etc.) in rapid pictures of incisive power, though
otherwise the heroic deeds of the Germans in 1870 resulted in but few heroic
deeds in art.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">In</span> the beginning of the century the man who did not wear a uniform was
not a proper subject for art unless he lived in Italy as a peasant or a
robber. That is to say, painters were either archæologists or tourists; when
they did not dive into the past they sought their romantic ideal in the distance.
Italy, where monumental painting had first seen the light, was the earliest goal
for travellers, and satisfied the desire of artists, since, for the rest of the world,
it was still enveloped in poetic mystery. Only in Rome, in Naples, and in
Tuscany was it thought possible to meet with human beings who had not
become vulgar and hideous under the influence of civilisation. There they still
preserved something of the beauty of Grecian statues. There artists were less
afraid of being diverted from absolute beauty by the study of nature, and
thus an important principle was carried. Instead of copying directly from
antique statues, as David and Mengs had done before them, painters began
to study the descendants of those who had been the models of the old Roman
sculptors; and so it was that, almost against their will, they turned from
museums to look rather more closely into nature, and from the past to cast
a glance into the present.</p>

<p>To <i>Leopold Robert</i> belongs the credit of having opened out this new province
to an art which was enclosed in the narrow bounds of Classicism. He owes
his success with the public of the twenties and his place in the history of art
entirely to the fact that in spite of his strict classical training he was one of
the first to interest himself, however little, in contemporary life. Hundreds
of artists had wandered into Italy and seen nothing but the antique until this
young man set out from Neufchâtel in 1818 and became the painter of the
Italian people. What struck him at the first glance was the character of the
people, together with their curious habits and usages, and their rude and
picturesque garb. &ldquo;He wished to render this with all fidelity,&rdquo; and especially
&ldquo;to do honour to the absolute nobility of that people which still bore
a trace of the heroic greatness of their forefathers.&rdquo; Above all, he fancied
that he could find this phenomenon of atavism amongst the bandits; and
as Sonnino, an old brigand nest, had been taken and the inhabitants removed
to Engelsburg shortly after his arrival, a convenient opportunity was offered
to him for making his studies in this place. The pictures of brigand life
which he painted in the beginning of the twenties soon found a most profitable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>119</span>
market. &ldquo;Dear M. Robert,&rdquo; said the fashionable guests who visited his
studio by the dozen, &ldquo;could you paint a little brigand, if it is not asking too
much?&rdquo; Robbers with sentimental qualms were particularly prized: for
instance, at the moment when they were fondling their wives, or praying
remorsefully to God, or watching over the bed of a sick child.</p>

<p>From brigands he made a transition to the girls of Sorrento, Frascati,
Capri, and Procida, and to shepherd lads, fishers, pilgrims, hermits, and
<i>pifferari</i>. Early in the twenties, when he made an exhibition of a number
of these little pictures in Rome, it effectually prepared the way for his fame;
and when he sent a succession of larger pictures to the Paris Salon in 1824-31
he was held as one of the most brilliant masters of the French school, to
whom Romanticists and Classicists paid the same honour. In the first
of these pictures, painted in 1824, he had represented a number of peasants
listening to a Neapolitan fisherman improvising to the accompaniment of a
harmonica. &ldquo;The Return from a Pilgrimage to the Madonna dell&rsquo; Arco&rdquo;
of 1827 is the painting of a triumphal waggon yoked with oxen. Upon it are
seated lads and maidens adorned with foliage, and in their gay Sunday best.
An old <i>lazzarone</i> is playing the mandolin, and girls are dancing with tambourines,
whilst a young man springs round clattering his castanets, and a couple of
boys, to complete the seasons of life, head the procession. His third picture,
&ldquo;The Coming of the Reapers to the Pontine Marshes,&rdquo; was the chief work
in the Salon of 1831 after the &ldquo;Freedom&rdquo; of Delacroix. Heine accorded
him a classical passage of description, and the orthodox academical critics
were liberal with most unmerited praise, treating the painter as a dangerous
revolutionary who was seducing art into the undignified naturalism of Ribera
and Caravaggio. Robert, the honest, lamblike man, who strikes us now as
being a conscientious follower of the school of David!</p>

accord with his own paintings! &ldquo;I try,&rdquo; he wrote to a friend in 1819, &ldquo;to
follow Nature in everything. Nature is the
only teacher who should be heard. She alone
inspires and moves me, she alone appeals to
me: it is Nature that I seek to fathom, and
in her I ever hope to find the special impulse
for work.&rdquo; She is a miracle to him, and one
that is greater than any other, a book in
which &ldquo;the simple may read as well as the
great.&rdquo; He could not understand &ldquo;how
painters could take the old masters as their
model instead of Nature, who is the only
great exemplar!&rdquo; What is to be seen in
his pictures is merely an awkward transference
of David&rsquo;s manner of conception
and representation to the painting of Italian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>120</span>
peasants&mdash;a scrupulously careful adaptation of classical rules to romantic
subjects. He looked at modern Italians solely through the medium of
antique statuary, and conducts us to an Italy which can only be called
Leopold Robert&rsquo;s Italy, since it never existed anywhere except in
Robert&rsquo;s map. All his figures have the movement of some familiar work
of antique sculpture, and that expression of cherished melancholy which
went out of fashion after the time of Ary Scheffer. Never does one see in his
pictures a casual and unhackneyed gesture in harmony with the situation.
It seems as if he had dressed up antique statues or David&rsquo;s Horatii and his
Sabine women in the costume of the Italian peasantry, and grouped them
for a <i>tableau vivant</i> in front of stage scenery, and in accordance with Parisian
rules of composition. His peasants and fishers make beautiful, noble, and
often magnificent groups. But one can always give the exact academic rules
for any particular figure standing here and not there, or in one position and
not in another. His pictures are much too official, and obtrusively affect the
favourite pyramid form of composition.</p>

<p>But as they are supposed to be pictures of Italian manners, the contrast
between nature and the artificial construction is almost more irritating than
it is in David&rsquo;s mythological representations. It is as if Robert had really
never seen any Italian peasants, though he maintains all the while that he is
depicting their life. The hard outlines and the sharp bronze tone of his works
are a ghastly evidence of the extent to which the sense of colour had become
extinct in the school of David. It was merely form that attracted him; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>121</span>
sun of Italy left him indifferent. The absence of atmosphere gives his figures
an appearance of having been cut out of picture sheets. O great artists of
Holland, masters of atmospheric effect and of contour bathed in light, what
would you have said to such heartless silhouettes! In his youth Robert had
been a line engraver, and he adapted the prosaic technique of line engraving to
painting. However, he was a transitional painter, and as such he has an
historical interest. He was a modern Tasso, too, and on the strength of the
adventurous relationship to Princess Charlotte Napoleon, which ultimately
drove him to suicide, he could be used with effect as the hero of a novel.
Through the downfall of the school of David his star has paled&mdash;one more
proof that only Nature is eternal, and that conventional painting falls into
oblivion with the age that saw it rise. &ldquo;I wished to find a <i>genre</i> which was
not yet known, and this <i>genre</i> has had the fortune to please. It is always an
advantage to be the first.&rdquo; With these words he has himself indicated, in a
way which is as modest as it is accurate, the ground of his reputation amongst
contemporaries, and why it is that the history of art cannot quite afford to
forget him.</p>

<p>Amongst the multitude of those who, incited by Robert&rsquo;s brilliant successes,
made the Spanish staircase in Rome the basis of their art, <i>Victor Schnetz</i>, by
his &ldquo;Vow to the Madonna&rdquo; of 1831, specially succeeded in winning public
favour. At a later time his favourite themes were the funerals of children,
inundations, and the like; but his arid method of painting contrasts with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>122</span>
sentimental melancholy of these subjects in a fashion which is not particularly
agreeable.</p>

<p>It was <i>Ernest Hébert</i> who first saw Italy with the eyes of a painter. He
might be called the Perugino of this group. He was the most romantic of
the pupils of Delaroche, and owed his conception of colour to that painter.
His spiritual father was Ary Scheffer. The latter has discovered the poetry
of sentimentality; Hébert the poetry of disease. His pictures are invariably
of great technical delicacy. His style has something femininely gracious,
almost languishing: his colouring is delicately fragrant and tenderly melting.
He is, indeed, a refined artist who occupies a place by himself, however
mannered the melancholy and sickliness of his figures may be. In &ldquo;The
Malaria&rdquo; of 1850 they were influenced by the subject itself. The barge
gliding over the waters of the Pontine Marshes, with its freight of men, women,
and children, seems like a gloomy symbol of the voyage of life; the sorrow
of the passengers is that of resignation: dying they droop their heads like
withering flowers. But later the fever became chronic in Hébert. The
interesting disease returned
even where it was out of place,
as it does still in the pictures
of his followers. The same
fate befell the painters of Italy
which befalls tourists. What
Robert had seen in the country
as the first comer whole generations
saw after him, neither
more nor less than that. The
pictures were always variations
on the old theme, until
in the sixties Bonnat came
with his individual and realistic
vision.</p>

<p>In Germany, where &ldquo;the
yearning for Italy&rdquo; had been
ventilated in an immoderate
quantity of lyrical poems ever
since the time of Wackenroder&rsquo;s
<i>Herzensergiessungen</i>,
<i>August Riedel</i> represented this
phase of modern painting;
and as Leopold Robert is still
celebrated, Riedel ought not
to be forgotten. Riedel lived
too long (1800-1883), and, as
he painted nothing but bad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>123</span>
pictures during the last thirty years of his life, what he had done in his youth was
forgotten. At that time he was the first apostle of Leopold Robert in Germany,
and as such he has his importance as an innovator. When he began his career
in the Munich Academy in 1819 Peter Langer, a Classicist of the order of Mengs,
was still director there. Riedel also painted classical subjects and church
pictures&mdash;&ldquo;Christ on the Mount of Olives,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Resurrection of Lazarus,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Peter and Paul healing the Lame.&rdquo; But when he returned from Italy
in 1823 he reversed the route which others had taken: the classic land set him
free from Classicism, and opened his eyes to the beauty of life. Instead of
working on saints in the style of Langer, he painted beautiful women in the
costume of modern Italy. His &ldquo;Neapolitan Fisherman&rsquo;s Family&rdquo; was for
Germany a revelation similar to that which Robert&rsquo;s &ldquo;Neapolitan Improvisator&rdquo;
had been for France. The fisherman, rather theatrically draped, is
sitting on the shore, while his wife and his little daughter listen to him
playing the zither. The blue sea, dotted with white sails, and distant Ischia
and Cape Missene, form the background; and a blue heaven, dappled with
white clouds, arches above. Everything was of an exceedingly conventional
beauty, but denoted progress in comparison with Robert. It already announced
that search for brilliant effects of light which henceforward became a characteristic
of Riedel, and gave him a peculiar position in his own day. &ldquo;Even
hardened connoisseurs,&rdquo; wrote Emil Braun from Rome about this time,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>124</span>
&ldquo;stand helpless before this magic of colouring. It is often long before they
are able to persuade themselves that such glory of colour can be produced by
the familiar medium of oil painting, and with materials that any one can buy
at a shop where pigments are sold.&rdquo; Riedel touched a problem&mdash;diffidently,
no doubt&mdash;which was only taken up much later in its full extent. And if
Cornelius said to him, &ldquo;You have fully attained what I have avoided with the
greatest effort during the course of my whole life,&rdquo; it is none the less true that
Riedel&rsquo;s Italian girls in the full glow of sunlight have remained, in spite of
their stereotyped smile, so reminiscent of Sichel, better able to stand the test
of galleries than the pictures of the Michael-Angelo of Munich. Before his
&ldquo;Neapolitan Fisherman&rsquo;s Family,&rdquo; which went the world over like a melody
from Auber&rsquo;s <i>Masaniello</i>, before his &ldquo;Judith&rdquo; carrying the head of Holofernes
in the brightest light of morning, before his &ldquo;Girls Bathing&rdquo; in the dimness of
the forest, and before his &ldquo;Sakuntala,&rdquo; painted &ldquo;with refined effects of light,&rdquo;
the cartoon painters mumbled and grumbled, and raised hue and cry over
the desecration of German art; but Riedel&rsquo;s friends were just as loud in
proclaiming the witchery of his colour, and &ldquo;the Southern sunlight which he
had conjured on to his palette,&rdquo; to be splendid beyond the powers of comprehension.
It is difficult at the present day to understand the fame that he once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>125</span>
had as &ldquo;a pyrotechnist in pigments.&rdquo; But the results which he achieved
by himself in colouring, long before the influence of the Belgians in Germany,
will always give him a sure place in the history of German art. And these
qualities were unconsciously inherited by his successors, who troubled their
heads no further about the pioneer and founder.</p>

<p>Those who painted the East with its clear radiance, its interesting people,
and its picturesque localities, stand in opposition to the Italian enthusiasts.
They are the second group of travellers. Gros had given French art a vision
of that distant magic land, but he had had no direct disciples. Painters were
as yet in too close bondage to their classical proclivities to receive inspiration
from Napoleon&rsquo;s expedition into Egypt. But the travels of Chateaubriand
and the verse of Byron, and then the Greek war of liberation, and, above all,
the conquest of Algiers, once more aroused an interest in these regions, and,
when the revolution of the Romanticists had once taken place, taught art a
way into the East. Authors, journalists, and painters found their place in
this army of travellers. The first view of men and women standing on the
shore in splendid costume, with turbans or high sheepskin hats, and surrounded
by black slaves, or mounted upon horses richly caparisoned, or listening to
the roll of drums and the
muezzin resounding from the
minarets, was like a scene
from <i>The Arabian Nights</i>.
The bazaars and the harems,
the quarters of the Janizaries
and gloomy dungeons were
visited in turn. Veiled women
were seen, and mysterious
houses where every sound was
hushed. At first the Moors,
obedient to the stern laws of
the Koran, fled before the
painters as if before evil
spirits, but the Moorish
women were all the more
ready to receive these conquerors
with open arms.
Artists plunged with rapture
into a new world; they anointed
themselves with the oil
of roses, and tasted all the
sweets of Oriental life. The
East was for the Byronic
enthusiasts of 1830 what
Italy had been for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>126</span>
Classicists. Could anything be imagined more romantic? You went on
board a steamer provided with all modern comforts and all the appliances
of the nineteenth century, and it carried you thousands of years back in
the history of the world; you set foot on a soil where the word progress did
not exist&mdash;in a land where the inhabitants still sat in the sun as if cemented
to the ground, and wore the same costumes in which their forefathers had sat
there two thousand years ago. Here the Romanticists not only found nature
decked in the rich hues which satisfied their passion for colour, but discovered
a race of people possessed of that beauty which, according to the Classicists,
was only to be seen in the Italian peasants. They beheld &ldquo;men of innate
dignity and remarkable distinction of pose and gesture.&rdquo; Thus a new experience
was added to life. There was the East, where splendour and simplicity,
cruelty and beauty, softness of temper and savage austerity, and brilliant
colour and blinding light are more completely mingled than anywhere else in
the world; there was the East, where rich tints laugh in the midst of squalor
and misery, the brightness of earlier days in the midst of outworn usages,
and the pride of art in the midst of ruined villages. It was so great, so unfathomable,
and so like a fairy tale that it gave every one the chance of discovering
in it some new qualities.</p>

<p>For <i>Delacroix</i>, the Byron of painting, it was a splendid setting for passion
in its unfettered wildness and its unscrupulous daring. He, who had lived
exclusively in the past, now turned to the observation of living beings, as may
be seen in his &ldquo;Algerian Women,&rdquo; his &ldquo;Jewish Wedding,&rdquo; his &ldquo;Emperor of
Morocco,&rdquo; and his &ldquo;Convulsionaries of Tangier.&rdquo; Amongst the Orientals
he also found the hotly flaming sensuousness and primitive wildness which
beset his imagination with its craving for everything impassioned.</p>

<p>The great <i>charmeur</i>, the master of pictorial caprice, <i>Decamps</i>, found his
province in the East, because its sun was so lustrous, its costume so bright,
and its human figures so picturesque. If Delacroix was a powerful artist,
Decamps was no more than a painter,&mdash;but painter he was to his finger-tips.
He was indifferent to nothing in nature or history: he showed as much
enthusiasm for a pair of tanned beggar-boys playing in the sunshine at the
corner of a wall as for Biblical figures and old-world epics. He has painted
hens pecking on a dung-heap, dogs on the chase and in the kennel, monkeys
as scholars, and musicians in all the situations which Teniers and Chardin
loved. His &ldquo;Battle of Tailleborg&rdquo; of 1837 has been aptly termed the only
picture of a battle in the Versailles Museum. He looked on everything as
material for painting, and never troubled as to how another artist would
have treated the subject. There is an individuality in every one of his works;
not an individuality of the first order, but one that is decidedly charming and
that assures him a very high place amongst his contemporaries.</p>

<p>Having made a success in 1829 with an imaginary picture of the East, he
had a wish to see how far the reality corresponded with his ideas of Turkey,
and in the same year&mdash;therefore before Delacroix&mdash;he went on that journey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>127</span>
to the Greek Archipelago, Constantinople, and Asia Minor which became a
voyage of discovery for French painting. In the Salon of 1831 was exhibited
his &ldquo;Patrol of Smyrna,&rdquo; which at once made him one of the favourite French
painters of the time. Soon afterwards came the picture of the &ldquo;Pasha on his
Rounds,&rdquo; accompanied by a lean troop of running and panting guards, that of
the great &ldquo;Turkish Bazaar,&rdquo; in which he gave such a charming representation
of the gay and noisy bustle of an Oriental fair, those of the &ldquo;Turkish School,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;Turkish Café,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Halt of the Arab Horsemen,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Turkish
Butcher&rsquo;s Shop.&rdquo; In everything which he painted from this time forward&mdash;even
in his Biblical pictures&mdash;he had before his eyes the East as it is in modern
times. Like Horace Vernet, he painted his figures in the costume of modern
Arabs and Egyptians, and placed them in landscapes with modern Arab
buildings. But the largeness of line in these landscapes is expressive of something
so patriarchal and Biblical, and of such a dreamy, mystical poetry, that,
in spite of their modern garb, the figures seem like visions from a far distance.</p>

<p>Decamps&rsquo; painting never became trivial. All his pictures soothe and
captivate the eye, however much they disappoint, on the first glance, the
expectations which the older descriptions of them may have excited. Fifty
years ago it was said that Delacroix painted with colour and Decamps with
light; that his works were steeped in a bath of sunshine. This vibrating
light, this transparent atmosphere, which contemporaries admired, is not to
be found in Decamps&rsquo; pictures. Their brilliancy of technique is admirable,
but he was no painter of light. The world of sunshine in which everything
is dipped, the glow and lustre of objects in shining, liquid, and tremulous
air, is what Gustave Guillaumet first learnt to paint a generation later.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>128</span>
Decamps attained the effect of light in his pictures by the darkening of
shadows, precisely in the manner of the old school. To make the sky bright,
he threw the foreground into opaque and heavy shade. And as, in consequence
of the ground of bole used to produce his beautiful red tones, the dark
parts of his pictures gradually became as black as pitch, and the light parts
dead and spotty, he will rather seem to be a contemporary of Albert Cuyp
than of Manet.</p>

<p>As draughtsman to a German baron making a scientific tour in the East,
<i>Prosper Marilhat</i>, the third of the painters of Oriental life, was early in following
this career. He visited Greece, Asia Minor, and Egypt, and returned to
Paris in 1833 intoxicated with the beauties of these lands. Especially dear
to him was Egypt, and in his pictures he called himself, &ldquo;Marilhat the Egyptian.&rdquo;
Decamps had been blinded by the sharp contrast between light and
shadow in Oriental nature, by the vivid blaze of colour in its vegetation, and
by the tropical glow of the Southern sky. Marilhat took novelties with a
more quiet eye, and kept close to pure reality. He has not so much virtuosity
as Decamps, and in colour he is less daring, but he is perhaps more poetic,
and on that account, in the years 1833-44, he was prized almost more. The
exhibition of 1844, in which eight of his pictures appeared, closed his career.
He had expected the Cross of the Legion of Honour, but did not get it, and
this disappointment affected him so deeply that he became first hypochondriacal
and then mad. His early death at thirty-six set Decamps free from
a powerful rival.</p>

<p><i>Eugène Fromentin</i> went further in the same direction as Marilhat. He
knew nothing of the preference for the glowing hues of the tropics nor of the
fantastic colouring of the Romanticists. He painted in the spirit of a refined
social period in which no loud voice is tolerated, but only light and familiar
talk. The East gave him his grace; the proud and fiery nature of the Arab
horse was revealed to him. In his portraits Fromentin looks like a cavalry
officer. In his youth he had studied law, but that was before his acquaintance
with the landscape painter Cabat brought him to his true calling, and a sojourn
made on three different occasions&mdash;in 1845, 1848, and 1852&mdash;on the borders
of Morocco decided for him his specialty. By his descriptions of travels,
<i>A Year in Sahel</i>, which appeared in the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>, he became
known as a writer: it was only after 1857, however, that he became famous
as a painter. Fromentin&rsquo;s East is Algiers. While Marilhat tried to render
the marvellous clearness of the Southern light, and Decamps depicted the
glowing heat of the East, its dark brooding sky in the sultry hours of summer
and the grand outlines of its landscape, Fromentin has tried&mdash;and perhaps
with too much system&mdash;to express the grace and brilliant spirit of the East.
Taste, refinement, ductility, distinction of colouring, and grace of line are his
special qualities. His Arabs galloping on their beautiful white horses have
an inimitable chivalry; they are true princes in every pose and movement.
The execution of his pictures is always spirited, easy, and in keeping with
their high-bred tone. Whatever he does has the nervous vigour of a sketch,
with that degree of finish which satisfies the connoisseur. There is always
a coquetry in his arrangement of colour, and his tones are light and delicate
if they are not deep. In the landscape his little Arab riders have the effect
of flowers upon a carpet.</p>

<p>Afterwards, when naturalism was at its zenith, Fromentin was much
attacked for this wayward grace. He was accused of making a superficial
appeal to the eye, and of offering everything except truth. And for its substantive
fidelity Fromentin&rsquo;s &ldquo;East&rdquo; cannot certainly be taken very seriously.
He was a man of fine culture, and in his youth he had studied the old Dutch
masters more than nature; he even saw the light of the East through the
Dutch <i>chiaroscuro</i>. His pictures are subtle works of art, nervous in drawing
and dazzling in brilliancy of construction, but they are washed in rather than
painted, and stained rather than coloured. In his book he speaks himself
of the cool, grey shadows of the East. But in his pictures they turn to a
reddish hue or to brown. An effort after beauty of tone in many ways weakened
his Arab scenes. He looked at the people of the East too much with the
eyes of a Parisian. And the more his recollections faded, the more did he
begin to create for himself an imaginary Africa. He painted grey skies simply
because he was tired of blue; he tinted white horses with rosy reflections,
chestnuts with lilac, and dappled-greys with violet. The grace of his works
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>132</span>
became more and more an affair of affectation, until at last, instead of being
Oriental pictures, they became Parisian fancy goods, which merely recalled
the fact that Algiers had become a French town.</p>

<p>But after all what does it matter whether pictures of the East are true to
nature or not? Other people whose names are not Fromentin can provide
such documents. In his works Fromentin has expressed himself, and that
is enough. Take up his first book, <i>L&rsquo;été dans la Sahara</i>: by its grace of style
it claims a place in French literature. Or read his classic masterpiece, <i>Les
maîtres d&rsquo;autrefois</i>, published in 1876 after a tour through Belgium and Holland:
it will remain for ever one of the finest works ever written on art. A connoisseur
of such refinement, a critic who gauged the artistic works of Belgium
and Holland with such subtlety, necessarily became in his own painting an
epicure of beautiful tones. This man, who never made an awkward movement
nor uttered a brutal word, this sensitive, distinguished spirit could be
no more than a subtle artist who had eyes for nothing but the aristocratic
side of Eastern life. As a painter, however, he might wish to be true to nature;
he could be no more than this. His art, compact of grace and distinction,
was the outcome of his own nature. He is a descendant of those delicately
feminine, seductively brilliant, facile and spontaneous, sparkling and charming
painters who were known in the eighteenth century as <i>peintres des fêtes
galantes</i>. He is the Watteau of the East, and in this capacity one of the
most winning and captivating products of French art.</p>

<p>Finally, <i>Guillaumet</i>, the youngest and last of the group, found in the East
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>133</span>
peace: a scion of the Romanticists, there is none the less a whole world of
difference between him and them. While the Romanticists, as sons of a
flaccid, inactive period, lashed themselves into enthusiasm for the passion and
wild life of the East, Guillaumet, the child of a hurried and neurotic epoch,
sought here an opiate for his nerves. Where they saw contrasts he found
harmony; and he did not find it, like Fromentin, in what is understood as
<i>chic</i>. Manet&rsquo;s conception of colour had taught him that nature is everywhere

<p>This description of a day in Algiers in Guillaumet&rsquo;s <i>Tableaux algériens</i>
interprets the painter Guillaumet better than
any critical appreciation could possibly do.
For him the East is the land of dreams and
melting softness, a far-off health-resort for
neurotic patients, where one lies at ease in
the sun and forgets the excitements of Paris.
It was not what was brilliant and pictorial
in sparkling jewels and bright costume that
attracted him at all, but the silence, the
mesmeric spell of the East, the vastness of
the infinite horizon, the imposing majesty of
the desert, and the sublime and profound
peace of the nights of Africa. &ldquo;The Evening
Prayer in the Desert&rdquo; was the name of the
first picture that he brought back with him
in 1863. There is a wide and boundless plain;
the straight line of the horizon is broken by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>134</span>
few mountain forms and by the figures of a party belonging to a caravan;
but, bowed as they are in prayer, these figures are scarcely to be distinguished.
The smoke of the camp ascends like a pillar into the air. The monotony
of the wilderness seems to stretch endlessly to the right and to the left,
like a grand and solemn Nirvana smiting the human spirit with religious
delirium.</p>

<p>For Decamps and Marilhat the East was a great, red copper-block beneath
a blue dome of steel; a beautiful monster, bright and glittering. Guillaumet
has no wish to dazzle. His pictures give one the impression of intense and
sultry heat. His light is really &ldquo;<i>le frémissement visible des atomes aériens</i>.&rdquo;
Moreover, he did not see the chivalry of the East like Fromentin. The latter
was fascinated by the nomad, the pure Arab living in tent or saddle, the true
aristocrat of the desert, mounted on his white palfrey, hunting wild beasts
through fair blue and green landscapes. Poor folk who never owned a horse
are the models of Guillaumet. With their dogs&mdash;wild creatures who need
nothing&mdash;they squat in the sun as if with their own kin: they are the lower,
primitive population, the pariahs of the wilderness; tattered men whose life-long
siesta is only interrupted by the anguish of death, animal women whose
existence flows by as idly as in the trance of opium.</p>

<p>After the French Romanticists had shown the way, other nations contributed
their contingent to the painters of Oriental subjects. In Germany poetry
had discovered the East. Rückert imitated the measure and the ideas of the
Oriental lyric, and the Greek war of liberation quickened all that passionate
love for the soil of old Hellas which lives in the German soul. <i>Wilhelm Müller</i>
sang his songs of the Greeks, and in 1825 <i>Leopold Schefer</i> brought out his tale
<i>Die Persierin</i>. But just as the Oriental tale was a mere episode in German
literature, an exotic grafted on the native stem, so the Oriental painting produced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>135</span>
no leading mind in the country, but merely a number of good soldiers
who dutifully served in the troops of foreign commanders.</p>

<p><i>Kretszchmer</i> of Berlin led the way with ethnographical representations,
and was joined at a later time by Wilhelm Gentz and Adolf Schreyer of Frankfort.
<i>Gentz</i>, a dexterous painter, and, as a colourist, perhaps the most gifted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>136</span>
of the Berlin school in the sixties, is, in comparison with the great Frenchmen
who portrayed the East, a thoroughly arid realist. He brought to his
task a certain amount of rough vigour and restless diversity, together with
North German sobriety and Berlin humour. <i>Schreyer</i>, who lived in Paris,
belonged to the following of Fromentin. The Arab and his steed interested
him also. His pictures are bouquets of colour, dazzling the eye. Arabs in
rich and picturesque costume repose on the ground or are mounted on their
milk-white steeds, which rear and prance with tossing manes and wide-stretched
nostrils. The desert undulates away to the far horizon, now pale
and now caressed by the softened rays of the setting sun, which tip the
waves of sand with burnished gold. Schreyer was&mdash;for a German&mdash;a man
with an extraordinary gift for technique and a brilliantly effective
sense of life. The latter remark is specially true of his sketches. At
a later date&mdash;in 1875, after being with Lembach and Makart in Cairo&mdash;the
Viennese <i>Leopold Müller</i> found the domain of his art beneath
the clear sky, in the brightly coloured land of the Nile. Even his
sketches are often of great delicacy of colour, and the ethnographical
accuracy which he also possessed has long made him the most highly
valued delineator of Oriental life and a popular illustrator of works on
Egypt. The learned and slightly pedantic vein in his works he shares with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>137</span>
Gérôme, but by his greater charm of colour he comes still nearer to
Fromentin.</p>

<p>The route to the East was shown to the English by the glowing landscapes
of <i>William Müller</i>; but the English were just as unable to find a Byron amongst
their painters. <i>Frederick Goodall</i> has studied the classical element in the
East, and endeavoured to reconstruct the past from the present. Best known
amongst these artists was <i>J. F. Lewis</i>, who died in 1876 and was much talked
of in earlier days. For long years he wandered through Asia Minor, filling
his portfolios with sketches and his trunks with Oriental robes and weapons.
When he returned there was a perfect scramble for his pictures. They revealed
a new world to the English then, but no one scrambles for them now.
John Lewis was exceedingly diligent and conscientious; he studied the implements,
the costumes, and the popular types of the East with incredible
industry. In his harem pictures as in his representations of Arabian camp
life everything is painted, down to the patterns of embroidery, the ornaments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>138</span>
of turbans, and the pebbles on the sand. Even his water-colours are triumphs
of endurance; but patience and endurance are not sufficient to make an
interesting artist. John Lewis stands in respect of colour, too, more or less
on a level with Gentz. He has seized neither the dignity of the Mussulman
nor the grace of the Bedouin, but has contented himself with a faithful though
somewhat glaring reproduction of accessories. <i>Houghton</i> was the first who,
moving more or less parallel with Guillaumet, succeeded in delicately interpreting
the great peace and the mystic silence of the East.</p>

<p>The East was in this way traversed in all directions. The first comers
who beheld it with eager, excited eyes collected a mass of gigantic legends,
with no decided aim or purpose and driven by no passionate impulse, merely
eager to pluck here or there an exotic flower, or lightly to catch some small
part of the glamour that overspread all that was Eastern, piled up dreams
upon dreams, and gave it a gorgeous and fantastic life. There were deserts
shining in the sun, waves lashed by the storm, the nude forms of women,
and all the Asiatic splendour of the East: dark-red satin, gold, crystal, and
marble were heaped in confusion and executed in terrible fantasies of colour
in the midst of darkness and lightning. After this generation had passed like
a thunderstorm the <i>chic</i> of Fromentin was delicious. He profited by the
taste which others had excited. Painters of all nationalities overran the East.
The great dramas were transformed into elegies, pastorals, and idylls; even
ethnographical representations had their turn. Guillaumet summed up the
aims of that generation. His dreamy and tender painting was like a beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>139</span>
summer evening. The radiance of the blinding sky was mitigated, and a
peaceful sun at the verge of the horizon covered the steppes of sand, which it
had scorched a few hours before, with a network of rosy beams.</p>

<p>They were all scions of the Romantic movement. The yearning which
filled their spirits and drove them into distant lands was only another symptom
of their dissatisfaction with the present.</p>

<p>Classicism had dealt with Greek and Roman history by the aid of antique
statues, and next used the colours of the Flemish masters to paint Italian
peasantry. Romanticism had touched the motley life of the Middle Ages
and the richly coloured East; but both had anxiously held aloof from the
surroundings of home and the political and social relations of contemporaries.</p>

<p>It was obvious that art&rsquo;s next task was to bring down to earth again the
ideal that had hovered so long over the domain of ancient history, and then
winged its flight to the realms of the East. &ldquo;<i>Ah la vie, la vie! le monde est
là; il rit, crie, souffre, s&rsquo;amuse, et on ne le rend pas.</i>&rdquo; In these words the
necessity of the step has been indicated by Fromentin himself. The successful
delivery of modern art was first accomplished, the problem stated in 1789
was first solved, when the subversive upheaval of the Third Estate, which
had been consummating itself more and more imperiously ever since the
Revolution, found distinct expression in the art of painting. Art always
moves on parallel lines with religious conceptions, with politics, and with
manners. In the Middle Ages men lived in the world beyond the grave, and
so the subjects of painting were Madonnas and saints. According to Louis
XIV, everything was derived from the King, as light from the sun, and so
royalty by the grace of God was reflected in the art of his epoch. The royal
sun suffered total eclipse in the Revolution, and with this mighty change of
civilisation art had to undergo a new transformation. The 1789 of painting
had to follow on the politics of 1789: the proclamation of the liberty and
equality of all individuals. Only painting which recognised man in his full
freedom, no privileged class of gods and heroes, Italians and Easterns, could
be the true child of the Revolution, the art of the new age. Belgium and
Germany made the first diffident steps in this direction.</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE PAINTING OF HUMOROUS ANECDOTE</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">At</span> the very time when the East attracted the French Romanticists, the
German and Belgian painters discovered the rustic. Romanticism,
driven into strange and tropical regions by its disgust of a sluggish, colourless
and inglorious age, now planted a firm foot upon native soil. Amid
rustics there was to be found a conservative type of life which perpetuated
old usages and picturesque costume.</p>

<p>It is not easy for a dilettante to enter into sympathetic relationship with
these early pictures of peasant life. They are gaudy in tone, smooth as
metal, and the figures stand out hard against the atmosphere, as if they had
been cut from a picture-sheet. But the historian has no right to be merely
a dilettante. It would be unfair of him to make the artistic conceptions of
the present time the means of depreciating the past. For, after all, works of
the past are only to be measured with those of their own age, and when one
once remembers what an importance these modest &ldquo;little masters&rdquo; had for
their time it is no longer difficult to treat them with justice. In an age when
futile and aimless intentions lost their way in theory and imitation of the
&ldquo;great painting&rdquo; there blossomed here, and for the first time, a certain
individuality of mind and temper. While Cornelius, Kaulbach, and their
fellows formed a style which was ideal in a purely conventional sense, and
epitomised the art of the great masters according to method, the &ldquo;<i>genre</i>
painters&rdquo; seized upon the endless variety of nature, and, after a long period
of purely reproductive painting, made the first diffident attempt to set art
free from the curse of system and the servile repetition of antiquated forms.</p>

<p>Even as regards colour they have the honour of preparing the way for a
restoration in the technique of painting. Their own defects in technique
were not their fault, but the consequence of that fatal interference of Winckelmann
through which art lost its technical traditions. They did not enjoy
the advantages of issuing from a long line of ancestors. In a certain sense
they had to make a beginning in the history of art by themselves; for between
them and the older German painting they only met with men who held the
ability to paint as a shame and a disgrace. With the example of the old
Dutch and Flemish masters before them, they had to knit together the bonds
which these men had cut; and considering the æsthetic ideas of the age, this
reference to Netherlandish models was an event of revolutionary importance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>141</span>
In doing this they may have
been partially influenced by
Wilkie, who made his tour in
Germany in 1825, and whose
pictures had a wide circulation
through the medium
of engraving. And from
another side attention was
directed to the old Dutch
masters by Schnaase&rsquo;s letters
of 1834. While the entire
artistic school which took its
rise from Winckelmann gave
the reverence of an empty,
formal idealism to classical
antiquity and the Cinquecento,
applying their standards
to all other periods,
Schnaase was the first to
give an impulse to the historical
consideration of art.
In this way he revealed wide
and hitherto neglected regions to the creative activity of modern times. The
result of his book was that the Netherlandish masters were no longer held to
be &ldquo;the apes of vulgar nature,&rdquo; but took their place as exquisite artists
from whom the modern painter had a great deal to learn.</p>

<p>In Munich the conditions of a popular, national art were supplied by the
very site of the town. Since the beginning of the century Munich had been
peculiarly the type of a peasant city, the capital of a peasant province; it
had a peasantry abounding in old-fashioned singularities, gay and motley in
costume as in their ways of life, full of bright and easy-going good-humour,
and gifted with the Bavarian force of character. Here it was, then, that
&ldquo;the resort to national traits&rdquo; was first made. And if, in the event, this
painting of rustic life produced many monstrosities, it remained throughout
the whole century an unfailing source from which the art of Munich drew
fresh and vivid power.</p>

<p>Even in the twenties there was an art in Munich which was native to the
soil, and in later years shot up all the more vigorously through being for a
time cramped in its development by the exotic growths of the school of
Cornelius. It was as different from the dominant historical painting as the
&ldquo;<i>magots</i>&rdquo; of Teniers from the mythological machinery of Lebrun, and it
was treated by official criticism with the same contempt. Cornelius and
his school directed the attention of educated people so exclusively to themselves,
and so entirely proscribed the literature of the day, that what took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>142</span>
place outside their own circle in Munich was but little discussed. The vigorous
group of naturalists had not much to offer critics who wished to display their
knowledge by picking to pieces historical pictures, interpreting philosophical
cartoons, and pointing to similarities of style between Cornelius and Michael
Angelo. But for the historian, seeking the seeds of the present in the past,
they are figures worthy of respect. Setting their own straightforward conception
of nature against the eclecticism of the great painters, they laid the
foundation of an independent modern art.</p>

<p>The courtly, academic painting of Cornelius derived its inspiration from
the Sistine Chapel; the naturalism of these &ldquo;<i>genre</i> painters&rdquo; was rooted
in the life of the Bavarian people. The &ldquo;great painters&rdquo; dwelt alone in
huge monumental buildings; the naturalists, who sought their inspiration in
the life of peasants, in the life of camps, and in landscape, without troubling
themselves about antique or romantic subjects, furnished the material for
the first collections of modern art. Both as artists and as men they were
totally different beings. Cornelius and his school stand on the one side,
cultured, imperious, fancying themselves in the possession of all true art,
and abruptly turning from all who are not sworn to their flag; on the other
side stand the naturalists, brisk and cheery, rough it may be, but sound to the
core, and with a sharp eye for life and nature.</p>

<p>Painting in the grand style owed its origin to the personal tastes of the
king and to the great tasks to which it was occasionally set; independent of
princely favour, realistic art found its patrons amongst the South German
nobility and, at a later date,
in the circle of the Munich
Art Union, and seems the
logical continuation of that
military painting which, at
the opening of the century,
had its representatives in
Nuremberg, Augsburg, and
Munich. The motley swarm
of foreign soldiers which
overran the soil of Germany
incited Albrecht Adam,
Peter Hess, Johann Adam
Klein, and others, to represent
what they saw in a
fashion which was sincere
and simple if it was also
prosy. And when the warlike
times were over it was
quite natural that some of
the masters who had learnt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>143</span>
their art in camps should
turn to the representation of
peasant life, where they were
likewise able to find gay,
pictorial costumes. <i>Wilhelm
Kobell</i>, whose etchings of the
life of the Bavarian people
are more valuable than his
battle-pieces, was one of the
first to make this transition.
In 1820 sturdy <i>Peter Hess</i>
painted his &ldquo;Morning at
Partenkirche,&rdquo; in which he
depicted a simple scene of
mountain life&mdash;girls at a well
in the midst of a sunny landscape&mdash;in
a homely but poetic
manner. When this breach
had been made, Bürkel was
able to take the lead of the
Munich painters of rustic
subjects.</p>

<p><i>Heinrich Bürkel&rsquo;s</i> portrait
reveals a square-built giant,
whose appearance contrasts strangely with that of his celebrated contemporaries.
The academic artists sweep back their long hair and look
upwards with an inspired glance. Bürkel looks down with a keen eye
at the hard, rough, and stony earth. The academic artists had a mantle&mdash;the
mantle of Rauch&rsquo;s statues&mdash;picturesquely draped about their
shoulders; Bürkel dressed like anybody else. No attribute is added which
could indicate that he was a painter; neither palette, nor brush, nor
picture; beside him on the table there is&mdash;a mug of beer. There he
sits without any sort of pose, with his hand resting on his knee&mdash;rough,
athletic, and pugnacious&mdash;for all the world as if he were quite conscious of
his peculiarities. Even the photographer&rsquo;s demand for &ldquo;a pleasant smile&rdquo;
had no effect upon him. This portrait is itself an explanation of Bürkel&rsquo;s
art. His was a healthy, self-reliant nature, without a trace of romance,
sentimentality, affected humour, or sugary optimism. Amongst all his
Munich contemporaries he was the least academic in his whole manner of
feeling and thinking.</p>

<p>Sprung from the people, he became their painter. He was born, 29th May
1802, in Pirmasens, where his father combined a small farm with a public-house
and his mother kept a shop; and he had been first a tradesman&rsquo;s
apprentice, and then assistant clerk in a court of justice, before he came to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>144</span>
Munich in 1822. Here the Academy rejected him as without talent; but
while it shut the door against the pupil, life revealed itself to the master. He
went to the Schleissheimer Gallery, and sat there copying the pictures of
Wouwerman, Ostade, Brouwer, and Berghem, and developed his powers, by
the study of these Netherlandish masters, with extraordinary rapidity. His
first works&mdash;battles, skirmishes, and other martial scenes&mdash;are amateurish and
diffident attempts; it is evident that he was without any kind of guidance
or direction. All the more astonishing is the swiftness with which he acquired
firm command of abilities, admirable for that age, and the defiant spirit of
independence with which he went straight from pictures to nature, though
hardly yet in possession of the necessary means of expression. He painted
and drew the whole new world which opened itself before him: far
prospects over the landscape, mossy stones in the sunlight, numbers of
cloud-pictures, peasants&rsquo; houses with their surroundings, forest paths,
mountain tracks, horses, and figures of every description. The life of men
and animals gave him everywhere some opportunity for depicting it in
characteristic situations. And later, when he had settled down again
in Munich, he did not cease from wandering in the South German
mountains with a fresh mind. Up to old age he made little summer and
winter tours in the Bavarian highlands. Tegernsee, Rottach, Prien,
Berchtesgaden, South Tyrol, and Partenkirche were visited again and again,
on excursions for the week or the day; and he returned from them all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>145</span>
with energetic studies, from which were developed pictures that were not
less energetic.</p>

<p>For, as every artist is the result of two factors, of which one lies in himself
and the other in his age and surroundings, the performances of Bürkel are to
be judged, not only according to the requirements of the present day, but
according to the conditions under which they were produced. What is weak
in him he shares with his contemporaries; what is novel is his own most
peculiar and incontestable merit. In a period of false idealism worked up
in a museum&mdash;false idealism which had aped from the true the way in which
one clears one&rsquo;s throat, as Schiller has it, but nothing more indicative of genius&mdash;in
a period of this accomplishment Bürkel preferred to expose his own
insufficiency rather than adorn himself with other people&rsquo;s feathers; at a
time which prided itself on representing with brush and pigment things for
which pen and ink are the better medium, he looked vividly into life; at a
time when all Germany lost itself aimlessly in distant latitudes, he brought
to everything an honest and objective fidelity which knew no trace of romantic
sentimentalism; and by these fresh and realistic qualities he has become the
father of that art which rose in Munich in a later day. Positive and exact
in style, and far too sincere to pretend to raise himself to the level of the old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>146</span>
masters by superficial imitation, he was the more industrious in penetrating
the spirit of nature and showing his love for everything down to its
minutest feature; weak in the sentiment for colour, he was great in his
feeling for nature. That was Heinrich Bürkel, and his successors had to
supplement what was wanting in him, but not to wage war against his

<p>The peculiarity of all his works, as of those of the early Dutch and
Flemish artists, is the equal weight which he lays on figures and on landscape.
In his eyes the life of man is part of a greater whole; animals
and their scenic surroundings are studied with the same love, and in his
most felicitous pictures these elements are so blended that no one feature
predominates at the expense of another. Seldom does he paint interiors,
almost always preferring to move in free and open nature. But here his
field is extraordinarily wide.</p>

<p>Those works in which he handled Italian subjects form a group by themselves.
Bürkel was in Rome from 1829 to 1832, the very years in which
Leopold Robert celebrated his triumphs there; but curious is the difference
between the works of the Munich and those of the Swiss painter. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>147</span>
latter are beautiful postures, poetic ideas, and all the academical formulas;
in the former unvarnished, naturalistic bluntness of expression. Even in
Italy he kept romantic and academic art at a distance. They had no power
over the rough, healthy, and sincere nature of the artist. He saw nothing
in Italy that he had not met with at home, and he painted things as he saw
them, honestly and without beatification.</p>

<p>To find material Bürkel did not need to go far. Picture to yourself a
man wandering along the banks of the Isar, and gazing about him with a still
and thoughtful look. A healthy peasant lass with a basket, or a plough
moving slowly in the distance behind a sweating yoke of horses, is quite
enough to fill him with feelings and ideas.</p>

<p>His peculiar domain was the high-road, which in the thirties and the
forties, before the railways had usurped its traffic, was filled with a much
more manifold life than it is to-day. Waggons and mail-carts passed along
before the old gateways; in every village there were taverns inviting the
wayfarer to rest, and blacksmiths sought for custom on the road. There
were vehicles of every description, horses at the forge, posting-stages, change
of teams, the departure of marketing folk, and passengers taking their seats
or alighting. Here horses were being watered, and an occasion was given for
brief dialogues between the coachman and his fares. There travellers surprised
by a shower were hurrying under their umbrellas into an inn; or, in wintry
weather, they were waiting impatiently, wrapped up in furs, whilst a horse
was being shod.</p>

<p>The beaten tracks through field and forest offered much of the same sort.
Peasants were driving to market
with a cart-load of wood. Horses
stood unyoked at a drinking-trough
whilst the driver, a muscular
fellow with great sinews,
quietly enjoyed his pipe. Along
some shadowy woodland path a
team drew near to a forge or
a lonely charcoal-burner&rsquo;s hut,
where the light flickered, and
over which there soared a bare
and snowy mountain peak.</p>

<p>Such pictures of snow-clad
landscape were a specialty of
Bürkel&rsquo;s art, and in their simplicity
and harmony are to be
ranked with the best that he has
done. Heavily freighted wood-carts
passing through a drift,
waggons brought to a standstill
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>148</span>
in the snow, raw-boned woodmen
perspiring as they load
them in a wintry forest, are
the accessory objects and
figures.</p>

<p>But life in the fields attracted
him also. Having a
love of representing animals,
he kept out of the way of
mowers, reapers, and gleaners.
His favourite theme is
the hay, corn, or potato harvest,
which he paints with
much detail and a great display
of accessory incidents.
Maids and labourers, old and
young, are feverishly active
in the construction of hay-cocks,
or, in threatening
weather, pile up waggons,
loaded as high as a house,
with fresh trusses.</p>

<p>In this enumeration all
the rustic life of Bavaria has
been described. It is only the
Sunday and holiday themes,
the peculiar motives of the
<i>genre</i> painter, that are wanting.
And in itself this is
an indication of what gives
Bürkel his peculiar position.</p>

<p>By their conception his
works are out of keeping
with everything which the
contemporary generation of &ldquo;great painters&rdquo; and the younger <i>genre</i>
painters were attempting. The great painters had their home in museums;
Bürkel lived in the world of nature. The <i>genre</i> painters, under the influence
of Wilkie, were fond of giving their motive a touch of narrative interest, like
the English. Cheerful or mournful news, country funerals, baptisms, and
public dinners offered an excuse for representing the same sentiment in varying
keys. Their starting-point was that of an illustrator; it might be very pretty
in itself, but it was too jovial or whimpering for a picture. Bürkel&rsquo;s works
have no literary background; they are not composed of stories with a
humorous or sentimental tinge, but depict with an intimate grasp of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>149</span>
subject the simplest events of life. He neither offered the public lollipops,
nor tried to move them and play upon their sensibilities by subjects which
could be spun out into a novel. He approached his men, his animals, and
his landscapes as a strenuous character painter, without gush, sentimentality,
or romanticism. In contradistinction from all the younger painters of rustic
subjects, he sternly avoided what was striking, peculiar, or in any way extraordinary,
endeavouring to paint everyday life in the house or the farmyard,
in the field or upon the highway, in all plainness and simplicity.</p>

<p>At first, indeed, he thought it necessary to satisfy the demands of the age
by, at any rate, painting in a broad and epical manner. The public collections
chiefly possess pictures of his which contain many figures: &ldquo;The Return
from the Mountain Pasture,&rdquo; &ldquo;Coming Back from the Bear Hunt,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Cattle Show,&rdquo; and &ldquo;From the Fair&rdquo;; scenes before an inn at festivals, or
waggoners setting out, and the like. But in these works the scheme of composition
and the multitude of figures have a somewhat overladen and old-fashioned
effect. On the other hand, there are pictures scattered about in
private collections which are of a simplicity which was unknown at the time:
dusty roads with toiling horses, lonely charcoal burners&rsquo; huts in the dimness
of the forest, villages in rain or snow, with little figures shivering from frost
or damp as they flit along the street. From the very beginning, free from
the vices of <i>genre</i> and narrative painting and the search after interesting
subjects, he has, in these pictures, renounced the epical manner of representing
a complicated event. Like the moderns, he paints things which can be
grasped and understood at a glance.</p>

<p>But, after all, Bürkel occupies a position which is curiously intermediate.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>150</span>
His colour relegates him altogether to the beginning of the century. He
was himself conscious of the weakness of his age in this respect, and stands
considerably above the school of Cornelius, even where its colouring is best.
Yet, in spite of the most diligent study of the Dutch masters, he remained,
as a colourist, hard and inartistic to the end. Having far too much regard
for outline, he is not light enough with what should be lightly touched, nor
fugitive enough with what is fleeting. What the moderns leave to be indistinctly
divined he renders sharp and palpable in his drawing. He trims
and rounds off objects which have a fleeting form, like clouds. But although
inept in technique, his works are more modern in substance than anything
that the next generation produced. They have an intimacy of feeling beyond
the reach of the traditional <i>genre</i> painting. In his unusually fresh, simple,
and direct studies of landscape he did not snatch at dazzling and sensational
effects, but tried to be just to external nature in her work-a-day mood; and,
in the very same way, in his figures he aimed at the plain reproduction of
what is given in nature.</p>

<p>The hands of his peasants are the real hands of toil&mdash;weather-stained,
heavy, and awkward. There are no movements that are not simple and
actual. Others have told droller stories; Bürkel unrolls a true picture of the
surroundings of the peasant&rsquo;s life. Others have made their rustics persons
suitable for the drawing-room, and cleaned their nails; Bürkel preaches the
strict, austere, and pious study of nature. An entirely new age casts its
shadow upon this close devotion to life. In their intimacy and simplicity
his pictures contain the germ of what afterwards became the task of the
moderns. All who came after him in Germany were the sons of Wilkie until
Wilhelm Leibl, furnished with a better technical equipment, started in spirit
from the point at which Bürkel had left off.</p>

<p><i>Carl Spitzweg</i>, in whose charming little pictures tender and discreet sentiment
is united with realistic care for detail, must likewise be reckoned with
the few who strove and laboured in quiet, apart from the ruling tendency,
until their hour came. Thrown entirely on his own resources, without a
teacher, he worked his way upwards under the influence of the older painters.
By dint of copying he discovered their secrets of colour, and gave his works,
which are full of poetry, a remarkable impress of sympathetic delicacy,
suggestive of the old masters. One turns over the leaves of the album of
Spitzweg&rsquo;s sketches as though it were a story-book from the age of romance,
and at the same time one is astonished at the master&rsquo;s ability in painting.
He was a genius who united in himself three qualities which seem to be contradictory&mdash;realism,
fancy, and humour. He might be most readily compared
with Schwind, except that the latter was more of a romanticist than a realist,
and Spitzweg is more of a realist than a romanticist. The artists&rsquo; yearning
carries Schwind to distant ages and regions far from the world, and a positive
sense of fact holds Spitzweg firmly to the earth.</p>

<p>Like Jean Paul, he has the boundless fancy which revels in airy dreams,
but he is also like Jean Paul in having a cheery, provincial satisfaction in the
sights of his own narrow world. He has all Schwind&rsquo;s delight in hermits
and anchorites, and witches and magic and nixies, and he plays with dragons
and goblins like Boecklin; but, for all that, he is at home and entirely at his
ease in the society of honest little schoolmasters and poor sempstresses, and
gives shape to his own small joys and sorrows in a spirit of contemplation.
His dragons are only comfortable, Philistine dragons, and his troglodytes, who
chastise themselves in rocky solitudes, perform their penance with a kindly
irony. In Spitzweg a fine humour is the causeway between fancy and reality.
His tender little pictures represent the Germany of the forties, and lie apart
from the rushing life of our time, like an idyllic hamlet slumbering in Sunday
quietude. Indeed, his pictures come to us like a greeting from a time long
past.</p>

<p>There they are: his poor poet, a little, lean old man, with a sharp nose
and a night-cap, sits at his garret window scanning verses on his frozen fingers,
enveloped in a blanket drawn up to his chin, and protected from the inclemency
of the weather by a great red umbrella; his clerk, grown grey in the dust of
parchments, sharpens his quill with dim-sighted eyes, and feels himself part
of a bureaucracy which rules the world; his book-worm stands on the highest
ladder in the library, with books in his hand, books in his pockets, books
under his arms, and books jammed between his legs, and neglects the dinner-hour
in his peaceful enjoyment, until an angry torrent of scolding is poured
over his devoted head by the housekeeper; there is his old gentleman devoutly
sniffing the perfume of a cactus blossom which has been looked forward to
for years; there is his little man enticing his bird with a lump of sugar; the
widower glancing aside from the miniature of his better half at a pair of pretty
maidens walking in the park; the constable whiling away the time at the
town-gate in catching flies; the old-fashioned bachelor, solemnly presenting
a bouquet to a kitchen-maid who is busied at the market-well, to the amusement
of all the gossips watching him from the windows; the lovers who in
happy oblivion pass down a narrow street by the stall of a second-hand dealer,
where amidst antiquated household goods a gilded statuette of Venus reposes
in a rickety cradle; the children holding up their pinafores as they beg the
stork flying by to bring them a little brother.</p>

<p>Spitzweg, like Jean Paul, makes an effect which is at once joyous and
tender, <i>bourgeois</i> and idyllic. The postillion gives the signal on his horn
that the moment for starting has arrived; milk-maids look down from the
green mountain summit into the far country; hermits sit before their cells
forgotten by the world; old friends greet each other after years of separation;
Dachau girls in their holiday best pray in woodland chapels; school children
pass singing through a still mountain valley; maidens chatter of an evening
as they fetch water from the moss-grown well, or the arrival of the postman
in his yellow uniform brings to their windows the entire population of an old
country town.</p>

<p>The little man with the miserable figure of a tailor had been an apothecary
until he was thirty years of age, but he had an independent and distinctive
artistic nature which impresses itself on the memory in a way that is unforgettable.
It is only necessary to see his portrait as he sits at his easel in his
dressing-gown with his meagre beard, his long nose, and the droll look about
the corners of his eyes, to feel attracted by him before one knows his works.
Spitzweg reveals in them his own life: the man and the painter are one in him.
There is a pretty little picture of him as an elderly bachelor, looking out of the
window in the early morning and nodding across the roofs to an old sempstress
who had worked the whole night through without noticing that the day had
broken; that is the world he lived in, and the world which he has painted.
As a kind-hearted, inflexible Benedick, full of droll eccentricities, he lived
in the oldest quarter of Munich in a fourth-storey attic. His only visitor
was his friend Moritz Schwind, who now and then climbed the staircase to
the little room that looked over the roofs and gables and pinnacles to distant,
smoky towers. His studio was an untidy confusion of prosaic discomfort
and poetic cosiness.</p>

<p>Here he sat, an ossified hermit, <i>bourgeois</i>, and book-worm, as if he were in
a spider&rsquo;s nest, and here at a
little window he painted his delightful
pictures. Here he took
his homely meal at the rickety
little table where he sat alone in
the evening buried in his books.
A pair of heavy silver spectacles
with keen glasses sparkled on
his thick nose, and the great
head with its ironically twinkling
eyes rested upon a huge cravat
attached to a pointed stand-up
collar. When disturbed by
strangers he spoke slowly and
with embarrassment, though in
the society of Schwind he was
brilliant and satirical. Then he
became as mobile as quicksilver,
and paced up and down the
studio with great strides, gesticulating
and sometimes going
through a dramatic performance
in vivid mimicry of those of
whom he happened to be talking.</p>

<p>His character has the same mixture
of Philistine contentment and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>155</span>
genial comedy which gleams from his works with the freshness of dew. A touch
of the sturdy Philistinism of Eichendorf is in these provincial idylls of Germany;
but at the same time they display an ability which even at the present day
must compel respect. The whole of Romanticism chirps and twitters in
the Spitzweg Album, as from behind the wires of a birdcage. Everything is
here united: the fragrance of the woods and the song of birds, the pleasures
of travelling and the sleepy life of provincial towns, moonshine and Sunday
quiet, vagabonds, roving musicians, and the guardians of law, learned professors
and students singing catches, burgomasters and town-councillors,
long-haired painters and strolling players, red dressing-gowns, green slippers,
night-caps, and pipes with long stems, serenades and watchmen, rushing
streams and the trill of nightingales, rippling summer breezes and comely
lasses, stroking back their hair of a morning, and looking down from projecting
windows to greet the passers-by. In common with Schwind he shows
a remarkable capacity for placing his figures in their right surroundings.
All these squares, alleys, and corners, in which his provincial pictures are
framed, seem&mdash;minutely and faithfully executed as they are&mdash;to be localities
predestined for the action, though they are painted freely from memory.
Just as he forgot none of the characteristic figures which he had seen in his
youth, so he held in his memory the whimsical and marvellous architecture
of the country towns of Swabia and Upper Bavaria which he had visited for
his studies, with such a firm grip that it was always at his command; and he
used it as a setting for his figures as a musician composes an harmonious
accompaniment for a melody.</p>

<p>To look at his pictures is like wandering on a bright Sunday morning
through the gardens and crooked, uneven alleys of an old German town. At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>156</span>
the same time one feels that Spitzweg belonged to the present and not to the
period of the ingenuous Philistines. It was only after he had studied at the
university and passed his pharmaceutical examination that he turned to
painting. Nevertheless he succeeded in acquiring a sensitiveness to colour
to which nothing in the period can be compared. He worked through Burnett&rsquo;s
<i>Treatise on Painting</i>, visited Italy, and in 1851 made a tour, for the sake of
study, to Paris, London, and Antwerp, in company with Eduard Schleich.
In the gallery of Pommersfelden he made masterly copies from Berghem,
Gonzales Coquez, Ostade, and Poelenburg, and lived to see the appearance
of Piloty. But much as he profited by the principles of colour which then
became dominant, he is like none of his contemporaries, and stands as far
from Piloty&rsquo;s brown sauce as from the frigid hardness of the old <i>genre</i> painters.
He was one of the first in Germany to feel the really sensuous joy of painting,
and to mix soft, luxuriant, melting colours. There are landscapes of his
which, in their charming freshness, border directly on the school of Fontainebleau.
Spitzweg has painted bright green meadows in which, as in the
pictures of Daubigny, the little red figures of peasant women appear as bright
and luminous patches of colour. His woodland glades penetrated by the sun
have a pungent piquancy of colour such as is only to be found elsewhere
in Diaz. And where he diversified his desolate mountain glens and steeply
rising cliffs with the fantastic lairs of dragons and with eccentric anchorites,
he sometimes produced such bold colour symphonies of sapphire blue, emerald
green, and red, that his pictures seem like anticipations of Boecklin. Spitzweg
was a painter for connoisseurs. His refined cabinet pieces are amongst the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>157</span>
few German productions of their time which it is a delight to possess, and
they have the savour of rare delicacies when one comes across them in the
dismal wilderness of public galleries.</p>

<p>Bürkel&rsquo;s realistic programme was taken up with even greater energy by
<i>Hermann Kauffmann</i>, who belonged to the Munich circle from 1827 to 1833,
and then painted until his death in 1888 in his native Hamburg. His province
was for the most part that of Bürkel: peasants in the field, waggoners on the
road, woodmen at their labour, and hunters in the snowy forest. For the
first few years after his return home he used for his pictures the well-remembered
motives taken from the South German mountain district. A
tour in Norway, undertaken in 1843, gave him the impulse for a series of
Norwegian landscapes which were simple and direct, and of more than common
freshness. In the deanery at Holstein he studied the life of fishers. Otherwise
the neighbourhood of Hamburg is almost always the background of his
pictures: Harburg, Kellinghusen, Wandsbeck, and the Alster Valley. Concerning
him Lichtwark is right in insisting upon the correctness of intuition,
the innate soundness of perception which one meets with in all his works.</p>

<p>In Berlin the excellent <i>Eduard
Meyerheim</i> went on parallel lines
with these masters. An old tradition
gives him the credit of
having introduced the painting of
peasants and children into German
art. But in artistic power
he is not to be compared with
Bürkel or Kauffmann. They were
energetic realists, teeming with
health, and in everything they
drew they were merely inspired by
the earnest purpose of grasping
life in its characteristic moments.
But Meyerheim, good-humoured
and childlike, is decidedly inclined
to a sentimentally pathetic
compromise with reality. At the
same time his importance for
Berlin is incontestable. Hitherto
gipsies, smugglers, and robbers
were the only classes of human
society, with the exception of
knights, monks, noble ladies, and
Italian women, which, upon the
banks of the Spree, were thought
suitable for artistic representation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>158</span>
Friedrich Eduard Meyerheim sought out the rustic before literature
had taken this step, and in 1836 he began with his &ldquo;King of the Shooting
Match,&rdquo; a series of modest pictures in which he was never weary of representing
in an honest and sound-hearted way the little festivals of the peasant,
the happiness of parents, and the games of children.</p>

<p>He had grown up in Dantzic, and played as a child in the tortuous lanes
of the old free imperial city, amid trumpery shops, general dealers, and artisans.
Later, when he settled down in Berlin, he painted the things which had delighted
him in his youth. The travels which he made for study were not
extensive: they hardly led him farther beyond the boundaries of the Mark
than Hesse, the Harz district, Thüringen, Altenburg, and Westphalia. Here
he drew with indefatigable diligence the pleasant village houses and the
churches shadowed by trees; the cots, yards, and alleys; the weather-beaten
town ramparts, with their crumbling walls; the unobtrusive landscapes of
North Germany, lovely valleys, bushy hills, and bleaching fields, traversed by
quiet streams fringed with willows, and enlivened by the figures of peasants,
who still clung to so much of their old costume. His pictures certainly do not
give an idea of the life of the German people at the time. For the peasantry
have sat to Meyerheim only in their most pious mood, in Sunday toilette,
and with their souls washed clean. Clearness, neatness, and prettiness are
to be found everywhere in his pictures. But little as they correspond to the
truth, they are just as little
untrue through affectation,
for their idealism sprang from
the harmless and cheerful
temperament of the painter,
and from no convention of
the schools.</p>

<p>A homely, idyllic poetry is
to be found in his figures and
his interiors. His women and
girls are chaste and gracious.
It is evident that Meyerheim
had a warm sympathy for the
sorrows and joys of humble
people; that he had an understanding
for this happy family
life, and liked himself to take
part in these merry popular
festivals; that he did not
idealise the world according
to rules of beauty, but because
in his own eyes it
really was so beautiful. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>159</span>
&ldquo;King of the Shooting Match&rdquo; of 1836 (Berlin National Gallery) has as
a background a wide and pleasant landscape, with blue heights in the
distance and the cheerful summer sunshine resting upon them. In the foreground
are a crowd of figures, neatly composed after studies. The crowned
king of the match, adorned for a festival, stands proudly on the road by which
the procession of marksmen is advancing, accompanied by village music.
An old peasant is congratulating him, and the pretty village girls and peasant
women, in their gay rustic costumes, titter as they look on, while the neighbours
are merrily drinking his health. Then there is the &ldquo;Morning Lesson,&rdquo; representing
a carpenter&rsquo;s house, where an old man is hearing his grandson repeat
a school task; &ldquo;Children at Play,&rdquo; a picture of a game of hide-and-seek
amongst the trees; &ldquo;The Knitting Lesson,&rdquo; and the picture of a young wife
by the bed of a naked boy who has thrown off the bedclothes and is holding
up one of his rosy feet; and &ldquo;The Road to Church,&rdquo; where the market-place
is shadowed with lime trees and the fresh young girlish figures adorned in
their Sunday best. These are all pictures which in lithograph and copperplate
engraving once flooded all Germany and enraptured the public at exhibitions.</p>

<p>But the German <i>genre</i> picture of peasant life only became universally
popular after the village novel came into vogue at the end of the thirties.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>160</span>
Walter Scott was not only a
Romanticist, but the founder
of the peasant novel: he was
the first to study the life and
the human character of the
peasantry of his native land,
their rough and healthy merriment,
their humorous peculiarities,
and their hot-headed
love of quarrelling; and he led
the Romanticists from their
idyllic or sombre world of
dreams nearer to the reality
and its poetry. A generation
later Immermann created this
department of literature in
Germany by the Oberhof-Episode
of his <i>Münchhausen</i>.
&ldquo;The Village Magistrate&rdquo; was
soon one of those typical
figures which in literature became
the model of a hundred
others. In 1837 Jeremias Gotthelf
began in his <i>Bauernspiegel</i>
those descriptions of Bernese rustic life which found general favour
through their downright common sense. Berthold Auerbach, Otto Ludwig,
and Gottfried Keller were then active, and Fritz Reuter lit upon a more clear-cut
form for his tales in dialect.</p>

<p>The influence which these writers had upon painting was enormous. It
now turned everywhere to the life of the people, and took its joy and pleasure
in devoting itself to reality. And the rustic was soon a popular figure much
sought after in the picture market. Yet this reliance on poetry and fiction
had its disadvantage. For in Germany, also, a vogue was given to that
&ldquo;<i>genre</i> painting&rdquo; which, instead of starting with a simple, straightforward
representation of what the artist had seen, offered an artistically correct
composition of what he had invented, and indulged in a rambling display
of humorous narrative and pathetic pieces.</p>

<p>In Carlsruhe <i>Johann Kirner</i> was the first to work on these lines, adapting
the life of the Swabian peasantry to the purposes of humorous anecdote. In
Munich <i>Carl Enhuber</i> was especially fertile in the invention of comic episodes
amongst the rustics of the Bavarian highlands, and his ponderous humour
made him one of the favourite heroes of the Art Union. Every one was in
raptures over his &ldquo;Partenkirche Fair,&rdquo; over the charlatan in front of the
village inn, who (like a figure after Gerhard Dow) is bringing home to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>161</span>
multitude by his lofty eloquence the fabulous qualities of his soap for removing
spots; over that assembly of peasants which gave the painter an opportunity
for making clearly recognisable people to be found everywhere in any little
town, from the judge of the county court and the local doctor down to the
watchmen. His second hit was &ldquo;The Interrupted Card Party&rdquo;: the blacksmith,
the miller, the tailor, and other dignitaries of the village are so painfully
disturbed in their social reunion by the unamiable wife of the tailor that her
happy spouse makes his escape under the table. The house servant holds
out his blue apron to protect his master, whilst the miller and the blacksmith
try to look unconcerned; but a small boy who has accompanied his mother
with a mug discovers the concealed sinner by his slipper, which has come off.
The &ldquo;Session Day&rdquo; contains a still greater wealth of comical types: here
is the yard of a country assize court, filled with people, some of them waiting
their turn, some issuing in contentment or dejection.  Most contented, of
course, are a bridal pair from the mountains&mdash;a stout peasant lad and a buxom
maiden&mdash;who have just received official consent to their marriage.  Disastrous
country excursions&mdash;townspeople overtaken by rain on their arrival in the
mountains&mdash;were also a source of highly comical situations.</p>

<p>In Düsseldorf the reaction against the prevailing sentimentality necessarily
gave an impulse to art on these humorous lines. When it seemed as if the
mournfulness of the thirties
would never be ended, <i>Adolf
Schroedter</i>, the satirist of the
band of Düsseldorf artists in
those times, broke the spell
when he began to parody the
works of the &ldquo;great painters.&rdquo;
When Lessing painted &ldquo;The
Sorrowing Royal Pair,&rdquo;
Schroedter painted &ldquo;The
Triumphal Procession of King
Bacchus&rdquo;; when Hermann
Stilke produced his knights
and crusaders, Schroedter
illustrated <i>Don Quixote</i> as a
warning; and when Bendemann
gave the world &ldquo;The
Lamentation of Jeremiah&rdquo;
and &ldquo;The Lamentation of
the Jews,&rdquo; Schroedter executed
his droll picture &ldquo;The
Sorrowful Tanners,&rdquo; in which
the tanners are mournfully
regarding a hide carried away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>162</span>
by the stream. Since he was a humorist, and humour is rather an affair for
drawing than painting, the charming lithographs, &ldquo;The Deeds and Opinions
of Piepmeyer the Delegate,&rdquo; published in conjunction with Detmold, the
Hanoverian barrister, and author of the <i>Guide to Connoisseurship</i>, are perhaps
to be reckoned as his best performances. <i>Hasenclever</i> followed the
dilettante Schroedter as a delineator of the &ldquo;stolid Peter&rdquo; type, and painted
the &ldquo;Study&rdquo; and similar pictures for Kortum&rsquo;s <i>Jobsiade</i> with great technical
skill, and, at the same time, with little humour and much complacency.
By the roundabout route of illustration artists were gradually brought more
directly into touch with life, and painted side by side with melodramatic
brigands, rustic folk, or a student at a tavern on the Rhine, absurd people
reading the newspapers, comic men sneezing, or the smirking Philistine
tasting wine.</p>

<p><i>Jacob Becker</i> went to the Westerwald to sketch little village tragedies, and
won such popularity with his &ldquo;Shepherd Struck by Lightning&rdquo; that for a
long time the interest of the public was often concentrated on this picture in
the collection of the Staedel Institute. <i>Rudolf Jordan</i> of Berlin settled on
Heligoland, and became by his &ldquo;Proposal of Marriage in Heligoland&rdquo; one
of the most esteemed painters of Düsseldorf. And in 1852 <i>Henry Ritter</i>, his
pupil, who died young, enjoyed a like success with his &ldquo;Middy&rsquo;s Sermon,&rdquo;
which represents a tiny midshipman with comical zeal endeavouring to convert
to temperance three tars who are staggering against him. A Norwegian,
<i>Adolf Tidemand</i>, became the Leopold Robert of the North, and, like Robert,
attained an international success when, after 1845, he began to present his
compatriots, the peasants, fishers, and sailors of the shores of the North Sea,
to the public of Europe. There was no doubt that a true ethnographical
course of instruction in the life of a distant race, as yet unknown to the rest
of Europe, was to be gathered from his pictures, as from those of Robert, or
from the Oriental representations of Vernet. In Tidemand&rsquo;s pictures the
Germans learnt the Norwegian usage of Christmas, accompanied the son of
the North on his fishing of a night, joined the bridal party on the Hardanger
Fjord, or listened to the sexton giving religious instruction; sailed with fishing
girls in a skiff to visit the neighbouring village, or beheld grandmother and
the children dance on Sunday afternoon to father&rsquo;s fiddle. Norwegian
peasant life was such an unknown world of romance, and the costume so
novel, that Tidemand&rsquo;s art was greeted as a new discovery. That the truth
of his pictures went no further than costume was only known at a later time.
Tidemand saw his native land with the eyes of a Romanticist, as Robert saw
Italy, and, in the same one-sided way, he only visited the people on festive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>166</span>
occasions.  Though a born Norwegian, he, too, was a foreigner, a man who
was never familiar with the life of his country people, who never lived at home
through the raw autumn and the long winter, but came only as a summer visitor,
when nature had donned her bridal garb, and naturally took away with him
the mere impressions of a tourist. As he only went to Norway for recreation,
it is always holiday-tide and Sabbath peace in his pictures. He represents
the same idyllic optimism and the same kindly view of &ldquo;the people&rdquo; as did
Björnson in his earliest works; and it is significant that the latter felt himself
at the time so entirely in sympathy with Tidemand that he wrote one of his
tales, <i>The Bridal March</i>, as text to Tidemand&rsquo;s picture &ldquo;Adorning the
Bride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To seek the intimate poetry in the monotonous life of the peasant, and to
go with him into the struggle for existence, was what did not lie in Tidemand&rsquo;s
method of presentation; he did not live amongst the people sufficiently long
to penetrate to their depths. The sketches that resulted from his summer
journeys often reveal a keen eye for the picturesque, as well as for the spiritual
life of this peasantry; but later in Düsseldorf, when he composed his studies
for pictures with the help of German models, all the sharp characterisation was
watered down.  What ought to have been said in Norwegian was expressed
in a German translation, where the emphasis was lost.  His art is Düsseldorf
art with Norwegian landscapes and costumes; a course of lectures on the
manners and customs of Norwegian villages composed for Germans.  The
only thing which distinguishes Tidemand to his advantage from the German
Düsseldorfers is that he is less humorously and sentimentally disposed.
Pictures of his, such as &ldquo;The Lonely Old People,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Catechism,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Wounded Bear Hunter,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Grandfather&rsquo;s Blessing,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Sectarians,&rdquo;
etc., create a really pleasant and healthy effect by a certain actual simplicity
which they undoubtedly have.  Other men would have made a melodrama
out of &ldquo;The Emigrant&rsquo;s Departure&rdquo; (National Gallery in Christiania).
Tidemand portrays the event without any sort of emphasis, and feels his way
with tact on the boundary between sentiment and sentimentality. There is
nothing false or hysterical in the behaviour of the man who is going away for
life, nor in those who have come to see him off.</p>

<p>In Vienna the <i>genre</i> painters seem to owe their inspiration especially to
the theatre.  What was produced there in the province of grand art during
the first half of the century was neither better nor worse than elsewhere.  The
Classicism of Mengs and David was represented by <i>Heinrich Füger</i>, who had
a more decided leaning towards the operatic.  The representative-in-chief
of Nazarenism was <i>Josef Führich</i>, whose frescoes in the Altlerchenfeld Church
are, perhaps, better in point of colour than the corresponding efforts of the
Munich artists, though they are likewise in a formal way derivative from
the Italians.  Vienna had its Wilhelm Kaulbach in <i>Carl Rahl</i>, its Piloty in
<i>Christian Ruben</i>, who, like the Munich artist, had a preference for painting
Columbus, and was meritorious as a teacher.  It was only through portrait
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>167</span>
painting that Classicism and Romanticism were brought into some sort of
relation with life; and the Vienna portraitists of this older régime are even
better than their German contemporaries, as they made fewer concessions
to the ruling idealism. Amongst the portrait painters was <i>Lampi</i>, after whom
followed <i>Moritz Daffinger</i> with his delicate miniatures; but the most important
of them all was <i>Friedrich Amerling</i>, who had studied under Lawrence in
London and under Horace Vernet in Paris, and brought back with him
great acquisitions in the science of colour. In the first half of the century
these assured him a decided advantage over his German colleagues. It
was only later, when he was sought after as the fashionable painter of all
the crowned heads, that his art degenerated into mawkishness.</p>

<p><i>Genre</i> painting was developed here as elsewhere from the military picture.
As early as 1813 <i>Peter Krafft</i>, an academician of the school of David, had
exhibited a great oil-painting, &ldquo;The Soldier&rsquo;s Farewell&rdquo;&mdash;the interior of a
village room with a group of life-size figures. The son of the family, in grey
uniform, with a musket in his hand, is tearing himself from his young wife,
who has a baby on her arm and is trying in tears to hold him back. His old
father sits in a corner with folded hands beside his mother, who is also crying,
and has hid her face. In 1820 Krafft added &ldquo;The Soldier&rsquo;s Return&rdquo; as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>168</span>
pendant to this picture. It represents the changes which have taken place
in the family during the warrior&rsquo;s absence: his old mother is at rest in her
grave; his grey-headed father has become visibly older, his little sister has
grown up, and the baby in arms is carrying the musket after his father. They
are both exceedingly tiresome pictures; the colour is cold and grey, the figures
are pseudo-classical in modern costume, and the pathos of the subject seems
artificial and forced. Nevertheless a new principle of art is declared in them.
Krafft was the first in Austria to recognise what a rich province had been
hitherto ignored by painting. He warned his pupils against the themes of
the Romanticists. These, as he said, were worked out, since no one would
do anything better than the &ldquo;Last Supper of Leonardo da Vinci or the
Madonnas of Raphael.&rdquo; And he warmly advocated the conviction &ldquo;that
nothing could be done for historical painting so long as it refused to choose
subjects from modern life.&rdquo; Krafft was an admirable teacher with a sober
and clear understanding, and he invariably directed his pupils to the immediate
study of life and nature. The consequence of his career was that <i>Carl
Schindler</i>, <i>Friedrich Treml</i>, <i>Fritz L&rsquo;Allemand</i>, and others set themselves to
treat in episodic pictures the military life of Austria, from the recruiting
stage to the battle, and from the soldier&rsquo;s farewell to his return to his father&rsquo;s
house. A further result was that the Viennese <i>genre</i> painting parted company
with the academical and historic art.</p>

<p>Just at this time Tschischka and Schottky began to collect the popular
songs of the Viennese. Castelli gave a poetic representation of <i>bourgeois</i> life,
and Ferdinand Raimund brought it upon the stage in his dramas. Bauernfeld&rsquo;s
types from the life of the people enjoyed a rapid popularity. Josef
Danhauser, Peter Fendi, and Ferdinand Waldmüller went on parallel lines
with these authors. In their <i>genre</i> pictures they represented the Austrian
people in their joys and sorrows, in their merriment and heartiness and good-humour;
the people, be it understood, of Raimund&rsquo;s popular farces, not those
of the pavement of Vienna.</p>

<p><i>Josef Danhauser</i>, the son of a Viennese carpenter, occupied himself with
the artisan and <i>bourgeois</i> classes. David Wilkie gave him the form for his
work and Ferdinand Raimund his ideas. His studio scenes, with boisterous
art students caught by their surly teacher at the moment when they are
playing their worst pranks, gave pleasure to the class of people who, at a later
date, took so much delight in Emanuel Spitzer. His &ldquo;Gormandizer&rdquo; is a
counterpart to Raimund&rsquo;s <i>Verschwender</i>; and when, in a companion picture,
the gluttonous liver is supping up the &ldquo;monastery broth&rdquo; amongst beggars,
and his former valet remains true to him even in misfortune, Grillparzer&rsquo;s
<i>Treuer Diener seines Herrn</i> serves as a model for this type. Girls confessing
their frailty to their parents had been previously painted by Greuze. Amongst
those of his pictures which had done most to amuse the public was the representation
of the havoc caused by a butcher&rsquo;s dog storming into a studio.
In his last period he turned with Collins to the nursery, or wandered through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>169</span>
the suburbs with a sketch-book, immortalising the doings of children in the
streets, and drawing &ldquo;character heads&rdquo; of the school-teacher tavern <i>habitués</i>
and the lottery adventurer.</p>

<td class="tcr f80 pb2">ADORNING THE BRIDE.</td></tr></table>

<p>And this was likewise the province to which <i>Waldmüller</i> devoted himself.
Chubby peasant children are the heroes of almost all his pictures. A baby is
sprawling with joy on its mother&rsquo;s lap, while it is contemplated with proud
satisfaction by its father, or it is sleeping under the guardianship of a little
sister; a boy is despatched upon the rough path which leads to school, and
brings the reward of his conduct home with rapturous or dejected mien, or
he stammers &ldquo;Many happy returns of the day&rdquo; to grandpapa. Waldmüller
paints &ldquo;The First Step,&rdquo; the joys of &ldquo;Christmas Presents,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Distribution
of Prizes to Poor School Children&rdquo;; he follows eager juveniles to
the peep-show; he is to be met at &ldquo;The Departure of the Bride&rdquo; and at
&ldquo;The Wedding&rdquo;; he is our guide to the simple &ldquo;Peasant&rsquo;s Room,&rdquo; and
shows the benefit of &ldquo;Almsgiving.&rdquo; Though his pictures may seem old-fashioned
in subject nowadays, their artistic qualities convey an entirely
modern impression. Born in 1793, he anticipated the best artists of later
days in his choice of material. Both in his portraits and in his country scenes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>170</span>
there is a freshness and transparency of tone which was something rare among
the painters of that time.</p>

<p><i>Friedrich Gauermann</i> wandered in the Austrian Alps, in Steiermark, and
Salzkammergut, making studies of nature, the inhabitants, and the animal
world. In contradistinction from Waldmüller, painter of idylls, and the
humorist Danhauser, he aimed above all at ethnographical exactness.
With sincere and unadorned observation Gauermann represents the local
peculiarities of the peasantry, differentiated according to their peculiar
valleys; life on the pasture and at the market, when some ceremonial
occasion&mdash;a shooting match, a Sunday observance, or a church consecration&mdash;has
gathered together the scattered inhabitants.</p>

<p><i>Genre</i> painting in other countries worked with the same types. The
costume was different, but the substance of the pictures was the same.</p>

<p>In Belgium Leys had already worked in the direction of painting everyday
life; for although he had painted figures from the sixteenth century, they
were not idealised, but as rough and homely as in reality. When the passion
for truthfulness increased, as it did in the following years, there came a moment
when the old German tradition, under the shelter of which Leys yet took
refuge, was shaken off, and artists went directly to nature without seeking
the mediation of antiquated style. At that time Belgium was one of the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>171</span>
rising and thriving countries in Europe. It had private collections by the
hundred. Wealthy merchants rivalled one another in the pride of owning
works by their celebrated painters. This necessarily exerted an influence on
production. Pretty <i>genre</i> pictures of peasant life soon became the most
popular wares; as for their artistic sanction, it was possible to point to
Brouwer and Teniers, the great national exemplars.</p>

<p>At first, then, the painters worked with the same elements as Teniers.
The common themes of their pictures were the ale-house with its thatched
roof, the old musician with his violin, the mountebank standing in the midst
of a circle of people, lovers, or drinkers brawling. Only the costume was
changed, and everything coarse, indecorous, or unrestrained was scrupulously
excluded <i>ad usum Delphini</i>. That the deep colouring of the old masters
became meagre and motley was in Belgium also an inevitable result of the
helplessness in regard to colour which had been brought on by Classicism.
The pictorial <i>furia</i> of Adriaen Brouwer gave way to a polished porcelain
painting which hardly bore a trace of the work of the hand. Harsh and
gaudy reds and greens were especially popular.</p>

<tr><td class="captionx">WALDMÜLLER.&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;THE FIRST STEP.</td></tr></table>

<p>The first who began a modest career on these lines was <i>Ignatius van Regemorter</i>.
As one recognises the pictures of Wouwerman by the dappled-grey
horse, Regemorter&rsquo;s may be recognised by the violin. Every year he turned
out one picture at least in
which music was being played,
and people were dancing with
a rather forced gaiety. Then
came <i>Ferdinand de Braekeleer</i>,
who painted the jubilees of
old people, or children and old
women amusing themselves
at public festivities. Teniers
was his principal model, but
his large joviality was transformed
into a chastened
merriment, and his broad
laughter into a discreet smile.
Braekeleer&rsquo;s peasantry and
proletariat are of an idyllic
mildness; honest, pious souls
who, with all their poverty,
are as moral as they are
happy. <i>Henri Coene</i> elaborated
such themes as &ldquo;Oh,
what beautiful Grapes!&rdquo; or
&ldquo;A Pinch of Snuff for the
Parson!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>172</span></p>

<p>Madou&rsquo;s merit lies in having extended Belgian <i>genre</i> painting somewhat
beyond these narrow bounds; he introduced a greater variety of types verging
more on reality than that everlasting honest man painted by Ferdinand de
Braekeleer. <i>Madou</i> was a native of Brussels. There he was born in 1796,
and he died there in 1877. When he began his career Wappers had just
made his appearance. Madou witnessed his successes, but did not feel tempted
to follow him. Whilst the latter in his large pictures in the grand style aimed
at being Rubens <i>redivivus</i>, Madou embodied his ideas in fleeting pencil sketches.
A great number of lithographs of scenes from the past bore witness to his
conception of history. There was nothing in them that was dignified, nothing
that was stilted, no idealism and no beauty; in their tabards and helmets the
figures moved with the natural gestures of ordinary human beings. By the
side of great seigneurs, princes, and knights, and amid helmets and hose,
drunken scoundrels, tavern politicians, and village cretins started into view,
and grimaced and danced and scuffled. In Belgium his plates occupy a
position similar to that of the first lithographs of Menzel in Germany. But
Madou lingered for a still briefer period in the Pantheon of history; the tavern
had for him a yet greater attraction. The humorous books which he published
in Paris and Brussels first showed him in his true light. Having busied himself
for several years exclusively with drawings, he made his <i>début</i> in 1842
as a painter. It is difficult to decide how much Madou produced after that
date. The long period between 1842 and 1877 yields a crowded chronicle
of his works. Even in the seventies he was just as vigorous as at the beginning,
and though he was regarded as a jester during his lifetime he was honoured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>173</span>
as a great painter after his death. At the auction of his unsold works, pictures
fetched 22,000 francs, sketches reached 3200, water-colours 2150, and drawings
750. The present generation has reduced this over-estimation to its right
measure, but it has not shaken Madou&rsquo;s historical importance. He has a
firm position as the man who conquered modern life in the interests of Belgian
art, and he is the more significant for the <i>genre</i> painting of his age, as he eclipsed
all his contemporaries, even in Germany and England, in the inexhaustible
fund of his invention.</p>

<p>A merry world is reflected in his pictures. One of his most popular figures
is the ranger, a sly old fox with a furrowed, rubicund visage and huge ears,
who roves about more to the terror of love-making couples than of poachers,
and never aims at any one except for fun at the rural justice, a portly gentleman
in a gaudy waistcoat, emerging quietly at the far end of the road. He
introduces a varied succession of braggarts, poor fellows, down-at-heel and
out-at-elbows, old grenadiers joking with servant girls, old marquesses taking
snuff with affected dignity, charlatans at their booth, deaf and dumb flute-players,
performing dogs, and boys sick over their first pipe. Here and there
are fatuous or over-wise politicians solemnly opening a newly printed paper,
with their legs astraddle and their spectacles resting on their noses. Rascals
with huge paunches and blue noses fall asleep on their table in the ale-house,
and enliven the rest of the company by their snoring. At times the door is
opened and a scolding woman appears with a broom in her hand. On these
occasions the countenance of the toper is a comical sight. At the sound of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>174</span>
the beloved voice he endeavours to raise himself, and anxiously follows the
movements of his better half as he clings reeling to the table, or plants himself
more firmly in his chair with a resigned and courageous &ldquo;<i>J&rsquo;y suis, j&rsquo;y reste</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Being less disposed to appear humorous, <i>Adolf Dillens</i> makes a more
sympathetic impression. He, too, had begun with forced anecdotes, but after
a tour to Zealand opened his eyes to nature; he laid burlesque on one side,
and depicted what he had seen in unhackneyed pictures: sound and healthy
men of patriarchal habits. Even his method of painting became simpler
and more natural; his colouring, hitherto borrowed from the old masters,
became fresher and brighter. He emancipated himself from Rembrandt&rsquo;s
<i>chiaroscuro</i>, and began to look at nature without spectacles. There is something
poetic in his method of observation: he really loved these good people
and painted them in the unadorned simplicity of their life&mdash;cheery old age
that knows no wrinkles and laughing youth that knows no sorrows. He is
indeed one-sided, for a good fairy has banished all trouble from his happy
world; but his pictures are the product of a fresh and amiable temperament.
His usual themes are a friendly gathering at the ale-house, a conversation
beneath the porch, skating, scenes in cobblers&rsquo; workshops, a gust of wind
blowing an umbrella inside out; and if he embellishes them with little
episodic details, this tendency is so innocent that nobody can quarrel with him.</p>

<p>In France it was <i>François Biard</i>, the Paul de Kock of French painting,
who attained most success in the thirties by humorous anecdote. He devoted
his whole life to the comical representation of the minor trespasses and misfortunes
of the commonplace <i>bourgeoisie</i>. He had the secret of displaying
his comicalities with great aptitude, and of mocking at the ridiculous eccentricities
of the Philistine in an obvious and downright fashion. Strolling
players made fools of themselves at their toilette; lads were bathing whilst
a gendarme carried off their clothes; a sentry saluted a decorated veteran,
whose wife gratefully acknowledged the attention with a curtsey; the village
grandee held a review of volunteers with the most pompous gravity; a
child was exhibited at the piano to the admiration of its yawning relatives.
One of his chief pictures was called &ldquo;Posada Espagnol.&rdquo; The hero was a monk
winking at a beauty of forty who was passing by while he was being shaved.
Women were sitting and standing about, when a herd of swine dashing in
threw everything over and put the ladies to flight, and so called forth one of
those comic effects of terror in which Paul de Kock took such delight.</p>

<p>Biard was inexhaustible in these expedients for provoking laughter;
and as he had travelled far he had always in reserve a slave-market, a primeval
forest, or an ice-field to appease the curiosity of his admirers when there was
nothing more to laugh at. From the German standpoint he had importance
as an artist whose flow of ideas would have furnished ten <i>genre</i> painters;
and if he is the only representative of the humorously anecdotic picture in
France, the reason is that there earlier than elsewhere art was led into a more
earnest course by the tumult of ideas on social politics.</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE PICTURE WITH A SOCIAL PURPOSE</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">That</span> modern life first entered art, in all countries, under the form of
humorous anecdote is partly the consequence of the one-sided æsthetic
ideas of the period. In an age that was dominated by idealism it was forgotten
that Murillo had painted lame beggars sitting in the sun, Velasquez
cripples and drunkards, and Holbein lepers; that Rembrandt had so much
love for humble folk, and that old Breughel with a strangely sombre pessimism
turned the whole world into a terrible hospital. The modern man was hideous,
and art demanded &ldquo;absolute beauty.&rdquo; If he was to be introduced into
painting, despite his want of <i>beauté suprême</i>, the only way was to treat him as
a humorous figure which had to be handled ironically. Mercantile considerations
were also a power in determining this form of humour. At a time when
painting was forced to address itself to a public which was uneducated in
art, and could only appreciate anecdotes, such comicalities had the best
prospect of favour and a rapid sale. The object was to provoke laughter,
at all hazards, by drollness of mien, typical stupidity, and absurdity of
situation. The choice of figures was practically made according as they were
more or less serviceable for a humorous purpose. Children, rustics, and
provincial Philistines seemed to be most adapted to it. The painter treated
them as strange and naïve beings, and brought them before the public as a
sort of performing dogs, who could go through remarkable tricks just as if
they were human beings. And the public laughed over whimsical oddities
from another world, as the courtiers of Louis <span class="sc">XIV</span> had laughed in Versailles
when M. Jourdain and M. Dimanche were acted by the king&rsquo;s servants upon
the stage of Molière.</p>

<p>Meanwhile painters gradually came to remark that this humour <i>à l&rsquo;huile</i>
was bought at too dear a price. For humour, which is like a soap-bubble,
can only bear a light method of representation, such as Hokusai&rsquo;s drawing
or Brouwer&rsquo;s painting, but becomes insupportable where it is offered as a
laborious composition executed with painstaking realism. And ethical reasons
made themselves felt independently of these artistic considerations.</p>

<p>The drollness of these pictures did not spring from the characters, but
from an effort to amuse the public at the expense of the painted figures. As
a general rule a peasant is a serious, square-built, angular fellow. For his
existence he does battle with the soil; his life is no pleasure to him, but hard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>176</span>
toil. But in these pictures he appeared as a figure who had no aim or purport;
in his brain the earnestness of life was transformed into a romping game.
Painters laughed at the little world which they represented. They were not
the friends of man, but parodied him and transformed life into a sort of Punch
and Judy show.</p>

<p>And even when they did not approach their figures with deliberate irony,
they never dreamed of plunging with any sincere love of truth into the depths
of modern life. They painted modern matter without taking part in it, like
good children who know nothing of the bitter facts that take place in the
world. When the old Dutch painters laughed, their laughter had its historical
justification. In the pictures of Ostade and Dirk Hals there is seen all the
primitive exuberance and wild joy of life belonging to a people who had just
won their independence and abandoned themselves after long years of war
with a sensuous transport to the gladness of existence. But the smile of these
modern <i>genre</i> painters is forced, conventional, and artificial; the smile of a
later generation which only took the trouble to smile because the old Dutch
had laughed before them. They put on rose-coloured glasses, and through
these gaudy spectacles saw only a gay masque of life, a fair but hollow
deception. They allowed their heroes to pass such a merry existence that
the question of what they lived upon was never touched. When they painted
their tavern pictures they anxiously suppressed the thought that people who
drained their great mugs so carelessly possibly had sick children at home,
hungry and perishing with cold in a room without a fire. Their peasants
are the favoured sons of fortune: they sowed not, neither did they reap, nor
gathered into barns, but their Heavenly Father fed them. Poverty and vice
presented themselves merely as amiable weaknesses, not as great modern
problems.</p>

<p>Just at this time the way was being paved for the Revolution of 1848:
the people fought and suffered, and for years before literature had taken part
in this struggle. Before the Revolution the battle had been between the
nobility and the middle class; but now that the latter had to some extent
taken the place of the nobility of earlier days, there rose the mighty problem
of strife between the unproductive and the productive, between rich and
poor.</p>

<p>In England, the birthplace of the modern capitalistic system, in a country
where great industry and great landed property first ousted the independent
yeomanry and called forth ever sharper division between those who possessed
everything and those who possessed nothing, the unsolved problem of the
nineteenth century found its earliest utterance. More than sixty years ago,
in the year of Goethe&rsquo;s death, a new literature arose there, the literature of
social politics. With Ebenezer Elliott, who had been himself a plain artisan,
the Fourth Estate made its entry into literature; a workman led the train
of socialistic poets. Thomas Hood wrote his <i>Song of the Shirt</i>, that lyric of
the poor sempstress which soon spread all over the Continent. Carlyle, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>177</span>
friend and admirer of Goethe, came forward in 1843 as the burning advocate
of the poor and miserable in <i>Past and Present</i>. He wrote there that this
world was no home to the working-man, but a dreary dungeon full of mad
and fruitless plagues. It was an utterance that shook the world like a bomb.
Benjamin Disraeli&rsquo;s <i>Sybil</i> followed in 1845. As a novel it is a strange mixture
of romantic and naturalistic chapters, the latter seeming like a prophetic
announcement of Zola&rsquo;s <i>Germinal</i>. As a reporter Charles Dickens had in his
youth the opportunity of learning the wretchedness of the masses in London,
even in the places where they lurked distrustfully in dark haunts. In his
Christmas stories and his London sketches he worked these scenes of social
distress into thrilling pictures. The poor man, whose life is made up of bitter
weeks and scanty holidays, received his citizenship in the English novel.</p>

<p>In France the year 1830 was an end and a beginning&mdash;the close of the
struggles begun in 1789, and the opening of those which led to the decisive
battle of 1848. With the <i>roi bourgeois</i>, whom Lafayette called &ldquo;the best of
republicans,&rdquo; the Third Estate came into possession of the position to which
it had long aspired; it rose from the ranks of the oppressed to that of the
privileged classes. As a new ruling class it made such abundant capital
with the fruits of the Revolution of July that even in 1830 Börne wrote from
Paris: &ldquo;The men who fought against all aristocracy for fifteen years have
scarcely conquered&mdash;they have not yet wiped the sweat from their faces&mdash;and
already they want to found for themselves a new aristocracy, an aristocracy
of money, a knighthood of fortune.&rdquo; To the same purpose wrote Heine in
1837: &ldquo;The men of thought who, during the eighteenth century, were so
indefatigable in preparing the Revolution, would blush if they saw how self-interest
is building its miserable huts on the site of palaces that have been
broken down, and how, out of these huts, a new aristocracy is sprouting up
which, more ungraciously than the old, has its primary cause in money-making.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There the radical ideas of modern socialism were touched. The proletariat
and its misery became henceforward the subject of French poetry, though they
were not observed with any naturalistic love of truth, but from the romantic
standpoint of contrast. Béranger, the popular singer of <i>chansons</i>, composed
his <i>Vieux Vagabond</i>, the song of the old beggar who dies in the gutter; Auguste
Barbier wrote his Ode to Freedom, where <i>la sainte canaille</i> are celebrated
as immortal heroes, and with the scorn of Juvenal &ldquo;lashes those who drew
profit from the Revolution, those <i>bourgeois</i> in kid gloves who watched the
sanguinary street fights comfortably from the window.&rdquo; In 1842-43 Eugène
Sue published his <i>Mystères de Paris</i>, a forbidding and nonsensical book, but
one which made an extraordinary sensation, just because of the disgusting
openness with which it unveiled the life of the lower strata of the people.
Even the great spirits of the Romantic school began to follow the social and
political strife of the age with deep emotion and close sympathy. Already
in the course of the thirties socialistic ideas forced their way into the Romantic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>178</span>
school from every side. Their source was Saint Simon, whose doctrines first
found a wide circulation under Louis Philippe.</p>

<p>According to Saint Simon, the task of the new Christianity consisted in
improving as quickly as possible the fate of the class which was at once the
poorest and the most numerous. His pupils regarded him as the Messiah
of the new era, and went forth into the world as his disciples. George Sand,
the boldest feminine genius in the literature of the world, mastered these
seething ideas and founded the artisan novel in her <i>Compagnon du Tour de
France</i>. It is the first book with a real love of the people&mdash;the people as
they actually are, those who drink and commit deeds of violence as well as
those who work and make mental progress. In her periodical, <i>L&rsquo;Éclaireur
de l&rsquo;Indre</i>, she pleads the cause both of the artisan in great towns and of the
rustic labourer; in 1844 she declared herself as a Socialist, without qualification,
in her great essay <i>Politics and Socialism</i>, and she brought out her
celebrated <i>Letters to the People</i> in 1848.</p>

<p>The democratic tide of ideas came to Victor Hugo chiefly through the
religious apostle Lamennais, whose book, written in prison, <i>De l&rsquo;Esclavage
Moderne</i>, gave the same fuel to the Revolution of 1848 as the works of Rousseau
had done to that of 1789. &ldquo;The peasant bears the whole burden of the day,
exposes himself to rain and sun and wind, to make ready by his work the
harvest which fills our barns in the late autumn. If there are those who
think the lighter of him on that account, and will not accord him freedom and
justice, build a high wall round them, so that their noisome breath may not
poison the air of Europe.&rdquo; From the forties there mutters through Hugo&rsquo;s
poems the muffled sound of the Revolution which was soon to burst over
Paris, and thence to move, like a rolling thunderstorm, across Europe. In
place of the tricolor under which the <i>bourgeoisie</i> and the artisan class had
fought side by side eighteen years before, the banner of the artisan was hoisted
blood-red against the ruling <i>bourgeoisie</i>.</p>

<p>This <i>Zeitgeist</i>, this spirit of the age which had grown earnest, necessarily
guided art into another course; the painted humour and childlike optimism
of the first <i>genre</i> painters began to turn out a lie. In spite of Schiller, art
cannot be blithe with sincerity when life is earnest. It can laugh with the
muscles of the face, but the laughter is mirthless; it may haughtily declare
itself in favour of some consecrated precinct, in which nothing of the battles
and struggles of the outside world is allowed to echo; but, for all that, harsh
reality demands its rights. Josef Danhauser&rsquo;s modest little picture of 1836,
&ldquo;The Gormandizer,&rdquo; is an illustration of this. In a sumptuously furnished
room a company of high station and easy circumstances are seated at dinner.
The master of the house, a sleek little man, is draining his glass, and a young
dandy is playing the guitar. But an unwelcome disturbance breaks in. The
figure of a beggar, covered with rags and with a greasy hat in his hand, appears
at the door. The ladies scream, and a dog springs barking from under a
chair, whilst the flunkey in attendance angrily prepares to send the impudent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>179</span>
intruder about his business. That was the position which art had hitherto
taken up towards the social question. It shrank peevishly back as soon as
rude and brutal reality disturbed its peaceful course. People wished to see
none but cheerful pictures of life around them.</p>

<p>For this reason peasants were invariably painted in neat and cleanly
dress, with their faces beaming with joy, an embodiment of the blessing of
work and the delights of country life. Even beggars were harmless, peacefully
cheerful figures, sparkling with health and beauty, and enveloped in
æsthetic rags. But as political, religious, and social movements have always
had a vivid and forcible effect on artists, painters in the nineteenth century
could not in the long run hold themselves aloof from this influence. The voice
of the disinherited made itself heard sullenly muttering and with ever-increasing
strength. The parable of Lazarus lying at the threshold of the rich man
had become a terrible reality. Conflict was to be seen everywhere around,
and it would have been mere hardness of heart to have used this suffering
people any longer as an agreeable subject for merriment. A higher conception
of humanity, the entire philanthropic character of the age, made the jests at
which the world had laughed seem forced and tasteless. Modern life must
cease altogether before it can be a humorous episode for art, and it had become
earnest reality through and through. Painting could no longer affect trivial
humour; it had to join issue, and speak of what was going on around it. It
had to take its part in the struggle for aims that belonged to the immediate
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>180</span></p>

<p>Powerfully impressed by the Revolution of July, it made its first advance.
The Government had been thrown down after a blood-stained struggle, and
a liberated people were exulting; and the next Salon showed more than forty
representations of the great events, amongst which that of <i>Delacroix</i> took the
highest place in artistic impressiveness. The principal figure in his picture
is &ldquo;a youthful woman, with a red Phrygian cap, holding a musket in one
hand and a tricolor in the other. Naked to the hip, she strides forward over
the corpses, giving challenge to battle, a beautiful vehement body with a face
in bold profile and an insolent grief upon her features, a strange mixture of
Phryne, <i>poissarde</i>, and the goddess of Liberty.&rdquo; Thus has Heine described
the work while still under a vivid impression of the event it portrayed. In
the thick of the powder smoke stands &ldquo;Liberty&rdquo; upon the barricade, at
her right a Parisian gamin with a pistol in his hand, a child but already
a hero, at her left an artisan with a gun on his arm: it is the people
that hastens by, exulting to die the death for the great ideas of liberty
and equality.</p>

<p>The painter himself had an entirely unpolitical mind. He had drawn
his inspiration for the picture, not from experience, but out of <i>La Curée</i>, those
verses of Auguste Barbier that are ablaze with wrath&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">

<p class="noind">And by this allegorical figure he has certainly weakened its grip and directness;
but it was a bold, naturalistic achievement all the same. By this work
the great Romanticist became the father of the naturalistic movement, which
henceforward, supported by the revolutionary democratic press, spread more
and more widely.</p>

<p>The critics on these journals began to reproach painters with troubling
themselves too little about social and political affairs. &ldquo;The actuality and
social significance of art,&rdquo; it was written, &ldquo;is the principal thing. What is
meant by Beauty? We demand that painting should influence society, and
join in the work of progress. Everything else belongs to the domain of Utopias
and abstractions.&rdquo; The place of whimsicalities is accordingly taken by
sentimental and melodramatic scenes from the life of the poor. Rendered
enthusiastic by the victory of the people, and inspired by democratic sentiments,
some painters came to believe that the sufferings of the artisan class
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>181</span>
were the thing to be represented,
and that there was
nothing nobler than work.</p>

<p>One of the first to give
an example was <i>Jeanron</i>.
His picture of &ldquo;The Little
Patriots,&rdquo; produced in connection
with the Revolution
of July, was a glorification
of the struggle for freedom;
his &ldquo;Scene in Paris&rdquo; a protest
against the sufferings of
the people. He sought his
models amongst the poor of
the suburb, painted their
ragged clothes and their
rugged heads without idealisation.
For him the aim of
art was not beauty, but the
expression of truth&mdash;a truth,
no doubt, which made political
propaganda. It was
Jeanron&rsquo;s purpose to have
a socialistic influence. One
sees it in his blacksmiths
and peasants, and in that
picture &ldquo;The Worker&rsquo;s Rest&rdquo;
which in 1847 induced Thoré&rsquo;s
utterance: &ldquo;It is a melancholy
and barren landscape
from the neighbourhood of Paris, a plebeian landscape which hardly seems
to belong to itself, and which gives up all pretensions to beauty merely to
be of service to man. Jeanron is always plebeian, even in his landscapes:
he loves the plains which are never allowed to repose, on which there is
always labour; there are no beautiful flowers in his fields, as there is no
gold ornament on the rags of his beggars and labourers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And afterwards, during the early years of the reign of Louis Philippe,
when the tendency became once more latent, the Revolution of February
worked out what the Revolution of July had begun. Mediocre painters like
<i>Antigna</i> became famous because they bewailed the sorrows of the &ldquo;common
man&rdquo; in small and medium-sized pictures. Others began to display a greater
interest in rustics, and to take them more seriously than they had done in
earlier works. <i>Adolphe Leleux</i> made studies in Brittany, and discovered
earnest episodes in the daily life of the peasant, which he rendered with great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>182</span>
actuality. And after sliding back into Romanticism, as he did with his
Arragon smugglers, he enjoyed his chief success in 1849 with that picture at
the Luxembourg to which he was incited by the sad aspect of the streets
of Paris during the rising of 1848. The men who, driven by hunger and
misery, fought upon the barricades may be found in Leleux&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mot d&rsquo;Ordre.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> of 1851 even <i>Meissonier</i>, till then exclusively a painter
of <i>rococo</i> subjects, encroached on this province. In his picture of the barricades
(2 December 1851) heaps of corpses are lying stretched out in postures
which could not have been merely invented. The execution, too, has a nervous
force which betrays that even so calculating a spirit as Meissonier was at one
time moved and agitated. In his little smokers and scholars and waiting-men
he is an adroit but cold-blooded painter: here he has really delivered
himself of a modern epic. His &ldquo;Barricade&rdquo; (formerly in the Van Praet
Collection) is the one thrilling note in the master&rsquo;s work, which was elsewhere
so quiet. <i>Alexandre Antigna</i>, originally an historical painter, turned from
historical disasters to those which take place in the life of the lower strata of
the people. A dwelling of a poor family is struck by lightning; poor people
pack up their meagre goods with the haste of despair on the outbreak of fire;
peasants seek refuge from a flood upon the roof of their little house; petty
shopkeepers are driving with their wares across the country, when their nag
drops down dead in the shafts; or an old crone, cowering at the street corner,
receives the pence which her little daughter has earned by playing on the
fiddle.</p>

<p>But the artist in whose works the philanthropic if sentimental humour of
the epoch is specially reflected is that remarkable painter, made up of contradictions,
<i>Octave Tassaert</i>. Borrowing at one and the same time from
Greuze, Fragonard, and Prudhon, he painted subjects mythological, ribald,
and religious, boudoir pictures, and scenes of human misery. Tassaert was
a Fleming, a grandson of that Tassaert
who educated Gottfried Schadow and
died as director of the Berlin Academy
in 1788. His name has been for the
most part forgotten; it awakes only a
dim recollection in those who see &ldquo;The
Unhappy Family&rdquo; in the Luxembourg
<i>Musée</i>. But forty years ago he was
amongst the most advanced of his day,
and enjoyed the respect of men like
Delacroix, Rousseau, Troyon, and Diaz.
He took Chardin and Greuze as his
models, and is a real master in talent.
He was the poet of the suburbs, who
spoke in tender complaining tones of the
hopes and sufferings of humble people.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>183</span>
He painted the elegy of
wretchedness: suicide in
narrow garrets, sick children,
orphans freezing in the snow,
seduced and more or less
repentant maidens&mdash;a sad
train. He was called the
Correggio of the attic, the
Prudhon of the suburbs. His
labours are confined to eleven
years, from 1846 to 1857.
After that he sent no more
to the Salon and sulkily withdrew
from artistic life. He
had no wish ever to see his
pictures again, and sold them&mdash;forty-four
altogether&mdash;to a
dealer for two thousand francs
and a cask of wine. With
a glass in his hand he forgot
his misanthropy. He lived
almost unknown in a little
house in the suburbs with a
nightingale, a dog, and a little shop-girl for his sole companions.</p>

<p>But his nightingale died, and then the dog, who should have followed at
his funeral. He could not survive the blow. He broke his palette, threw
his colours into the fire, lit a pan of charcoal that he might die like &ldquo;The
Unhappy Family,&rdquo; and was found suffocated on the following day. On a
scrap of paper he had written, without regard to metre or orthography, a
few verses to his nightingale and his dog.</p>

<p>There is much that is magniloquent and sentimental in Tassaert&rsquo;s pictures.
His poor women perish with the big eyes of the heroines of Ary Scheffer.
Nevertheless he belongs to the advance line of modern art, and suffered shipwreck
merely because he gave the signal too early. The sad reality prevails
in his work. Merciless as a surgeon operating on a diseased limb, he made a
dissecting-room of his art, which is often brutal where his brush probes the
deepest wounds of civilisation. There is nothing in his pictures but wretched
broken furniture, stitched rags, and pale faces in which toil and hunger have
ploughed their terrible furrows. He painted the degeneration of man perishing
from lack of light and air. Himself a Fleming, he has found his greatest
follower in another Netherlander, <i>Charles de Groux</i>, whose sombre pessimism
dominates modern Belgian art.</p>

<p>In Germany, where the socialistic writings of the French and English
had a wide circulation, <i>Gisbert Flüggen</i>, in Munich known as the German
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>184</span>
Wilkie, was perhaps the first who
as early as the forties went somewhat
further than the humorous
representation of rustics, and
entered into a certain relation
with the social ideas of his age
in such pictures as &ldquo;The Interrupted
Marriage Contract,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Unlucky Gamester,&rdquo; &ldquo;The <i>Mésalliance</i>,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Decision of the Suit,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Disappointed Legacy
Hunter,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Execution for
Rent,&rdquo; and the like. Under his
influence Danhauser in Vienna
deserted whimsicalities for the
representation of social conflicts
in middle-class life. To say
nothing of his &ldquo;Gormandizer,&rdquo;
he did this in &ldquo;The Opening of
the Will,&rdquo; where in a somewhat
obtrusive manner the rich relations
of the deceased are grouped
to the right and the poor relations
to the left, the former rubicund,
sleek, and insolent, the latter pale, spare, and needily clad. An estimable
priest is reading the last testament, and informs the poor relatives with
a benevolent smile that the inheritance is theirs, whereon the rich give way
to transports of rage.</p>

<p>Yet more clearly, although similarly transposed into a sentimental key,
is the mood of the time just previous to 1848, reflected in the works of <i>Carl
Hübner</i> of Düsseldorf. Ernest Wilkomm in the beginning of the forties had
represented in his sensational <i>genre</i> pictures, particularly in the &ldquo;White
Slaves,&rdquo; the contrast between afflicted serfs and cruel landlords, between
rich manufacturers and famishing artisans; Robert Prutz had written his
<i>Engelchen</i>, in which he had announced the ruin of independent handicraft
by the modern industrial system. Soon afterwards the famine among the
Silesian weavers, the intelligence of which in 1844 flew through all Germany,
set numbers of people reflecting on the social question. Freiligrath made it
the subject of his verses, <i>Aus dem Schlesischen Gebirge</i>, the song of the poor
weaver&rsquo;s child who calls on Rübezahl&mdash;one of his most popular poems. And
yet more decisively does the social and revolutionary temper of the age find
an echo in Heine&rsquo;s <i>Webern</i>, composed in 1844. Even Geibel was impelled
to his poem <i>Mene Tekel</i> by the spread of the news, though it stands in curious
opposition to his manner of writing elsewhere. Carl Hübner therefore was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>185</span>
acting very seasonably when he likewise treated the distress of the Silesian
weavers in his first picture of 1845.</p>

<p>Hübner knew the life of the poor and the heavy-laden; his feelings were
with them, and he expressed what he felt. This gives him a position above
and apart from the rest in the insipidly smiling school of Düsseldorf, and sets
his name at the beginning of a new chapter in the history of German <i>genre</i>
painting. His next picture, &ldquo;The Game Laws,&rdquo; sprang from an occasion
which was quite as historical: a gamekeeper had shot a poacher. In 1846
followed &ldquo;The Emigrants,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Execution for Rent&rdquo; in 1847, and in 1848
&ldquo;Benevolence in the Cottage of the Poor.&rdquo; These were works in which he
continued to complain of the misery of the working classes, and the contrast
between ostentatious wealth and helpless wretchedness, and to preach the
crusade for liberty and human rights. In opposition to the usual idyllic
representations, he spoke openly for the first time of the material weight
oppressing large classes of men. Undoubtedly, however, the artistic powers
of the painter corresponded but little to the good intentions of the philanthropist.</p>

<p>In 1853 even the historical painter Piloty entered this path in one of his
earliest pictures, &ldquo;The Nurse&rdquo;: the picture represents a peasant girl in
service as a nurse in the town,
with her charge on her arm,
entering the dirty house of
an old woman with whom
she is boarding her own child.
The rich child, already dressed
out like a little lady, is exuberant
in health, whilst her
own is languishing in a dark
and cold room without food
or warm clothing.</p>

<p>In Belgium <i>Eugène de
Block</i> first took up these lines.
The artistic development of
his character is particularly
interesting, inasmuch as he
went through various transformations.
First he had
come forward in 1836 with
the representation of a brawl
amongst peasants, a picture
which contrasted with the
tameness of contemporary
painting by a native power
suggestive of Brouwer. Then,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>186</span>
following the example of Madou and Braekeleer, he occupied himself for
a long time with quips and jests. At a time when every one had a type to
which he remained true as long as he lived, Block chose poachers and game-keepers,
and represented their mutual cunning, now enveloping them, after
the example of Braekeleer, in the golden light and brown shadows of Ostade,
now throwing over them a tinge of Gallait&rsquo;s cardinal red. But this forced
humour did not satisfy him long; he let comicalities alone, and became the
serious observer of the people. A tender compassion for the poor may be
noticed in his works, though without doubt it often turns to a tearful sentimentalism.
He was an apostle of humanity who thundered against pauperism
and set himself up as spokesman on the social question; a tribune of the
people, who by his actions confirmed his reputation as a democratic painter.
This it is which places him near that other socialistic agitator who in those
days was filling Brussels with his fame.</p>

<p>Having gained the <i>Prix de Rome</i>, he was enabled to make a sojourn in the
Eternal City. He was thinking of his return. He was possessed of a lofty
ambition, and dreamt of rivalling the fame of the old masters. As a victor
he made an entry into his native land, into the good town of Dinant, which
received him like a mother. He was accompanied by a huge roll of canvas
like a declaration of war. But he needed a larger battle-field for his plans.
&ldquo;I imagine,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that the universe has its eyes upon me.&rdquo; So he went
on to Paris with his &ldquo;Patroclus&rdquo; and a few other pictures. No less than six
thousand artists had seen the work in Rome: a prince of art, Thorwaldsen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>188</span>
had said when he beheld it: &ldquo;This young man is a giant.&rdquo; And the young
man was himself of that opinion. With the gait of a conqueror he entered
Paris, in the belief that artists would line the streets to receive him. But
when the portals of the <i>Salon</i> of 1839 were opened he did not see his picture
there. It was skied over a door, and no one noticed it. Théophile Gautier,
Gustave Planché, and Bürger-Thoré wrote their articles without even mentioning
it with one word of praise or blame.</p>

<p>For one moment he thought of exhibiting it out of doors in front of the
Louvre, of calling together a popular assembly and summoning all France to
decide. But an application to the minister was met with a refusal, and he
returned to Brussels hanging his head. There he puffed his masterpiece,
&ldquo;The Fight round the Body of Patroclus,&rdquo; in magniloquent phrases upon
huge placards. A poet exclaimed, &ldquo;Hats off: here is a new Homer.&rdquo; The
<i>Moniteur</i> gave him a couple of articles. But when the Exhibition came,
artists were again unable to know what to make of it. The majority were of
an opinion that Michael Angelo was brutally parodied by these swollen muscles
and distorted limbs. And no earthquake disturbed the studios, as the painter
had expected. However, he was awarded a bronze medal and thanked in an
honest citizen-like fashion &ldquo;for the distinguished talent which he had displayed.&rdquo;
Then his whole pride revolted. He circulated caricatures and
cried out: &ldquo;This medal will be an eternal blot on the century.&rdquo; Then he
published in the <i>Charivari</i> an open letter to the king. &ldquo;Michael Angelo,&rdquo; he
wrote, &ldquo;never allowed himself to pass final judgment on the works of contemporary
artists, and so His Majesty, who hardly understands as much
about art as Michael Angelo, would do well not to decide on the worth of
modern pictures after a passing glance.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Antoine Wiertz</i>, the son of a gendarme who had once been a soldier of the
great Republic, was born in Dinant in 1806. By his mother he was a Walloon,
and he had German blood in him through his father, whose family had originally
come from Saxony. German moral philosophy and treatises on education
had formed the reading of his youthful years. He had not to complain of
want of assistance. At the declaration of Belgian independence he was five-and-twenty;
so his maturity fell in the proud epoch when the young nation
laid out everything to add artistic to political splendour. Even as a boy,
their only child, he was idolised by his parents, the old gendarme and the
honest charwoman. His first attempts were regarded by his relations as
marvels. The neighbours went into raptures over a frog he had modelled,
&ldquo;which looked just as if it were alive.&rdquo; The landlord of a tavern ordered a
signboard from him, and when it was finished the whole population stood
before it in admiration. A certain Herr Maibe, who was artistically inclined,
had his attention directed to the young genius, undertook all the expenses of
his education, and sent him to the Antwerp Academy. There he obtained a
government scholarship, and gained in 1832 the <i>Prix de Rome</i>. From the first
he was quite clear as to his own importance.</p>

<p>Even as a pupil at the Antwerp Academy he wrote in a letter to his father
contemptuously of his fellow-students&rsquo; reverence for the old masters. &ldquo;They
imagine,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that the old masters are invincible gods, and not men
whom genius may surpass.&rdquo; And instead of admonishing him to be modest,
his father answered with pride: &ldquo;Be a model to the youth of the future, so
that in later centuries young painters may say, &lsquo;I will raise myself to fame
as the great Wiertz did in Belgium.&rsquo;&rdquo; Such dangerous flattery would have
affected stronger characters. It needed only the Italian journey to send
him altogether astray. Michael Angelo made him giddy, as had been the
case with Cornelius, Chenavard, and many another. With all the ambition
of a self-taught man he held every touch of his brush to be important, and
was indignant if others refused to think the same. After his failures in Paris
and Brussels he began to find high treason in every criticism, and started a
discussion on &ldquo;the pernicious influence of journalism upon art and literature.&rdquo;
We find him saying: &ldquo;If any one writes ill of me when I am dead,
I will rise from the grave to defend myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In his hatred of criticism he resolved to exhibit no more, lived a miserable
existence till his death in 1865, and painted hasty and careless portraits, <i>pour</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>190</span>
<i>la soupe</i>, when he was in pressing need of money. These brought him at
first from three to four hundred, and later a thousand francs. He indulged in
colossal sketches, for the completion of which the State built him in 1850
a tremendous studio, the present <i>Musée Wiertz</i>. It stands a few hundred
paces from the Luxembourg station, to the extreme north of the town, in a
beautiful though rather neglected little park, a white building with a pillared
portico and a broad perron leading up to it. Here he sat in a fantastically
gorgeous costume, for ever wearing his great Rubens hat. Philanthropic
lectures on this world and the next, on the well-being of the people and the
diseases of modern civilisation, were the fruits of his activity. Whoever
loves painting for painting&rsquo;s sake need never visit the museum.</p>

<p>There there are battles, conflagrations, floods, and earthquakes; heaven
and earth are in commotion. Giants hurl rocks at one another, and try, like
Jupiter, to shake the earth with their frown. All of them delight in force,
and bring their muscles into play like athletes. But the painter himself is
no athlete, no giant as Thorwaldsen called him, and no genius as he fancied
himself to be. <i>Le singe des génies</i>, he conceived the notion of &ldquo;great art&rdquo;
purely in its relation to space, and believed himself greater than the greatest
because his canvases were of greater dimensions. When the ministry thought
of making him Director of the Antwerp Academy, after the departure of
Wappers, he wrote the following characteristic sentences: &ldquo;I gather from
the newspapers that I may be offered the place of Wappers.&rdquo; If in the moment
when the profound philosopher is pondering over sublime ideas people were
to say to him, &ldquo;Will you teach us the A, B, C? I believe that he whose
dwelling-place is in the clouds would fall straight from heaven to earth.&rdquo;
Living in an atmosphere of flattery at home, and overpowered by the incense
which was there offered to his genius, he could not set himself free from the
fixed idea of competing with Michael Angelo and Rubens. Below his picture
of &ldquo;The Childhood of Mary&rdquo; he placed the words: &ldquo;Counterpart to the
picture by Rubens in Antwerp treating the same subject.&rdquo; He offered his
&ldquo;Triumph of Christ&rdquo; to the cathedral there under the condition of its being
hung beside Rubens&rsquo; &ldquo;Descent from the Cross.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Rising up of Hell&rdquo;
he wished to exhibit of an evening in the theatre when it was opened for a
performance. During the waits the audience were to contemplate the picture
while a choir sang with orchestral accompaniment. But all these offers were
declined with thanks.</p>

<p>Such failures make men pessimists; but it was through them that Wiertz,
after being an historical painter, became the child of his age. He began to
hurl thunderbolts against the evils of modern civilisation. He preaches and
lashes and curses and suffers. The forms of which he makes use are borrowed
from the old masters. The man of Michael Angelo, with his athletic build,
his gigantic muscles, his nude body, the man of the Renaissance and not the
man of the nineteenth century, strides through his works; it is only in the
subject-matter of his pictures that the modern spirit has broken through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>191</span>
the old formula. All the questions which have been thrown out by the
philosophy and civilisation of the nineteenth century are reflected as vast
problems in his vast pictures. He fashions his brush into a weapon with
which he fights for the disinherited, for the pariahs, for the people. He is
bent on being the painter of democracy&mdash;a great danger for art.</p>

<p>He agitates in an impassioned way against the horrors of war. His
picture &ldquo;Food for Powder&rdquo; begins this crusade. A cannon is lying idle on
the wall of a fortress, and around this slumbering iron monster children are
playing at soldiers, with no suspicion that their sport will soon be turned
into bitter earnest, and that in war they will themselves become food for this
demon. In another picture, &ldquo;The civilisation of the Nineteenth Century,&rdquo;
soldiers intoxicated with blood and victory have broken into a chamber by
night and are stabbing a mother with her child. A third, &ldquo;The Last Cannon
Shot,&rdquo; hints dimly at the future pacification of the world. &ldquo;A Scene in Hell,&rdquo;
however, is the chief of the effusions directed against war. The Emperor
Napoleon in his grey coat and his historical three-cornered hat is languishing
in hell; wavering flames envelop him as with a flowing purple mantle, and
an innumerable multitude of mothers and sisters, wives and betrothed maidens,
children and fathers, from whom he has taken their dearest are pressing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>192</span>
round him. Fists are clenched against him, and screams issue from toothless,
raging mouths. He, on the other hand, with his arms crossed on his breast,
and his haughty visage stern and gloomy, stands motionless, looking fixedly
with satanic eyes upon the thousands whose happiness he has destroyed.</p>

<td class="tcr f80 pb2">THE FIGHT ROUND THE BODY OF PATROCLUS.</td></tr></table>

<p>In his &ldquo;Thoughts and Visions of a Decapitated Head&rdquo;, Wiertz, moved
by Victor Hugo&rsquo;s <i>Le dernier jour d&rsquo;un condamné</i>, makes capital punishment
a subject of more lengthy disquisition. The picture, which is made up of
three parts, is supposed to represent the feelings of a man, who has been
guillotined, during the first three minutes after execution. The border of
the picture contains a complete dissertation: &ldquo;The man who has suffered
execution sees his body dried up and in corruption in a dark corner; and
sees also, what it is only given to spirits of another world to perceive, the
secrets of the transmutation of matter. He sees all the gases which have
formed his body, and its sulphurous, earthy, and ammoniacal elements,
detach themselves from its decaying flesh and serve for the structure of other
living beings.... When that abominable instrument the guillotine is one
day actually abolished, may God be praised,&rdquo; and so on.</p>

<p>Beside this painted plea against capital punishment hangs &ldquo;The Burnt
Child,&rdquo; as an argument in favour of <i>crêches</i>. A poor working woman has for
one moment left her garret. Meanwhile a fire has broken out, and she returns
to find the charred body of her boy. In the picture &ldquo;Hunger, Madness, and
Crime&rdquo; he treats of human misery in general, and touches on the question of
the rearing of illegitimate children. There is a young girl forced to live on the
carrots which a rich man throws into the gutter. In consequence of a notification
to pay taxes she goes out of her mind, and with hellish laughter cuts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>193</span>
to pieces the baby who has brought her to ruin. Cremation is recommended
in the picture &ldquo;Buried too soon&rdquo;: there is a vault, and in it a coffin, the lid
of which has been burst open from the inside; through the cleft may be seen
a clenched hand, and in the darkness of the coffin the horror-stricken countenance
of one who is piteously crying for help.</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;Novel Reader&rdquo; he endeavours to show the baneful influence of
vicious reading upon the imagination of a girl. She is lying naked in bed,
with loosened hair and a book in her hand; her eyes are reddened with hysterical
tears, and an evil spirit is laying a new book on the couch, <i>Antonine</i>, by
Alexandre Dumas <i>Fils</i>. &ldquo;The Retort of a Belgian Lady&rdquo;&mdash;an anticipation
of Neid&mdash;glorifies homicide committed in the defence of honour. A Dutch
officer having taken liberties with a Belgian woman, she blows out his brains
with a pistol. In &ldquo;The Suicide&rdquo; the fragments of a skull may be seen flying
in all directions. How the young man who has just destroyed himself came
to this pass may be gathered from the book entitled <i>Materialism</i>, which lies
on his table. And thus he goes on, though the spectator feels less and less
inclined to take any serious interest in these lectures. For although the
intentions of Wiertz had now and then a touch of the sublime, he was neither
clear as to the limits of what could be represented nor did he possess the
capacity of expressing what he wished in artistic forms. Like many a German
painter of those years, he was a philosopher of the brush, a scholar in disguise,
who wrote out his thoughts in paint instead of ink.</p>

<p>Wiertz made painting a vehicle for more than it can render as painting:
with him it begins to dogmatise; it is a book, and it awakens a regret that
this rich mind was lost to authorship. There he might, perhaps, have done
much that was useful towards solving the social and philosophical questions
of the day; as he is, he has nothing to offer the understanding, and only
succeeds in offending the eye. A human brain with both great and trivial
ideas lays itself bare. But, like Cornelius, from the mere fulness of his ideas
he was unable to give them artistic expression. He groped from Michael
Angelo to Rubens, and from Raphael to Ary Scheffer, without realising that
the artistic utterance of all these masters had been an individual gift. The
career of Wiertz is an interesting psychological case. He was an abnormal
phenomenon, and he cannot be passed over in the history of art, because he
was one of the first who treated subjects from modern life in large pictures.
Never before had a genuinely artistic age brought forth such a monster, yet
it is impossible to ignore him, or deny that he claims a certain degree of importance
in the art history of the past century.</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE VILLAGE TALE</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">During</span> the decade following the year 1848 <i>genre</i> painting in Germany
threw off the shackles of the anecdotic style, and continued a development
similar to that of history, which, in the same country, flourished long
after it was moribund elsewhere. After the elder artists, who showed so much
zeal in producing perfectly ineffective little pictures, executed with incredible
pains and a desperate veracity of detail, there followed, from 1850, a generation
who were technically better equipped. They no longer confined themselves to
making tentative efforts in the manner of the old masters, but either borrowed
their lights directly from the historical painters in Paris, or were indirectly
made familiar with the results of French technique through Piloty. Subjects
of greater refinement were united with a treatment of colour which was less
offensive.</p>

<p>The childlike innocence which had given pleasure in Meyerheim and
Waldmüller was now thought to be too childlike by far. The merriment
which radiated from the pictures of Schroedter or Enhuber found no echo
amidst a generation which was tired of such cheap humour: the works of
Carl Hübner were put aside as lachrymose and sentimental efforts. When
the world had issued from the period of Romanticism there was no temptation
to be funny over modern life nor to make socialistic propaganda; for after
the Revolution of 1848 people had become reconciled to the changed order
of affairs and to life as it actually was&mdash;its cares and its worries, its mistakes
and its sins. It was the time when Berthold Auerbach&rsquo;s village tales ran
through so many editions; and, hand in hand with these literary productions,
painting also set itself to tell little stories from the life of sundry classes of the
people, amongst which rustics were always the most preferable from their
picturesqueness of costume.</p>

<p>At the head of this group of artists stands <i>Louis Knaus</i>, and if it is difficult
to hymn his praises at the present day, that is chiefly because Knaus mostly
drew upon that sarcastic and ironical characteristic which is such an unpleasant
moral note in the pictures of Hogarth, Schroedter, and Madou. The figures
of the old Dutch masters behave as if the glance of no stranger were resting
upon them: it is possible to share their joys and sorrows, which are not merely
acted. We feel at our ease with them because they regard us as one of themselves.
In Knaus there is always an artificial bond between the figures and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>195</span>
the frequenters of the exhibition. They plunge into the greatest extravagances
to excite attention, tickle the spectator to make him laugh, or cry
out to move him to tears. With the
exception of Wilkie, no <i>genre</i> painter
has explained his purpose more obtrusively
or in greater detail. Even when
he paints a portrait, by way of variation,
he stands behind with a pointer
to explain it. On this account the
portraits of Mommsen and Helmholtz
in the Berlin National Gallery are
made too official. Each of them is
visibly conscious that he is being
painted for the National Gallery, and
by emphasis and the accumulation of
external characteristics Knaus took
the greatest pains to lift these personalities
into types of the nineteenth-century
scholar.</p>

<p>Since popular opinion is wont to
represent the philologist as one careless
of outward appearance, and the investigator
of natural philosophy as an
elegant man of the world,&mdash;Mommsen must wear boots which have seen much
service, and those of Helmholtz must be of polished leather; the shirt of the
one must be genially rumpled, and that of the other must fit him to perfection.
By such obvious characterisation the Sunday public was satisfied, but those
who were represented were really deprived of character. It is not to be
supposed that in Mommsen&rsquo;s room the manuscripts of all his principal works
would lie so openly upon the writing-table and beneath it, so that every one
might see them: it is not probable that his famous white locks would flutter
so as he sat at the writing-table. Even the momentary gesture of the hand
has in both pictures something obtrusively demonstrative. &ldquo;Behold, with
this pen I have written the history of Rome,&rdquo; says Mommsen. &ldquo;Behold,
there is the famous ophthalmometer which I invented,&rdquo; says Helmholtz.</p>

<p>But as a <i>genre</i> painter Knaus has fallen still more often into such intolerable
stage gesticulation. The picture &ldquo;His Highness upon his Travels&rdquo;
is usually mentioned as that in which he reached his zenith in characterisation.
Yet is not this characterisation in the highest degree exaggerated?
Is not the expression apportioned to every figure, like parts to a theatrical
company, and does not the result seem to be strained beyond all measure?
Just look at the children, see how each plays a part to catch your eye. A
little girl is leaning shyly on her elder sister, who has bashfully thrust her
finger into her mouth: some are looking on with rustic simplicity, others
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>196</span>
with attention: a child smaller than the others is puckering up its face and
crying miserably. The prince, in whose honour the children are drawn up,
passes the group with complete indifference, while his companion regards
&ldquo;the people&rdquo; haughtily through his eyeglass. The schoolmaster bows low,
in the hope that his salary may be raised, whilst the stupid churchwarden
looks towards the prince with a jovial smile, as though he were awaiting his
colleague from the neighbouring village. Of course, they are all very intelligible
types; but they are no more than types. For the painter the mere
accident of the moment is the source of all life. Would that six-year-old
peasant child who stands with the greatest dignity in Knaus&rsquo;s picture as
&ldquo;The Village Prince&rdquo; have ever stood in that fashion, with a flower between
his teeth and his legs thrust apart, unless he had been carefully taught this
self-conscious pose by the painter himself? So that there may not be the
slightest doubt as to which of the shoemaker&rsquo;s apprentices is winning and
which is losing, one of them has to have a knowing smirk, whilst the other
is looking helplessly at his cards. And how that little Maccabee is acting
to the public in &ldquo;The First Profit!&rdquo; The old man in threadbare clothes,
who stands in an ante-chamber rubbing his hands in the picture &ldquo;I can
Wait&rdquo;; the frightened little girl who sees her bit of bread-and-butter imperilled
by geese in &ldquo;In Great Distress,&rdquo;&mdash;they have all the same deliberate
comicality, they are all treated with the same palpable carefulness, the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>197</span>
pointed and impertinently satirical sharpness. Even in &ldquo;The Funeral&rdquo;
he is not deserted by the humorous proclivity of the anecdotist, and the
schoolmaster has to brandish the bâton with which he is conducting the choir
of boys and girls as comically as possible. Knaus uses too many italics,
and underlines as if he expected his public to be very dull of understanding.
In this way he appeals to simple-minded people, and irritates those of more
delicate taste. The peasant sits in his pictures like a model; he knows that
he must keep quiet, and neither alter his pose nor his grimace, because otherwise
Knaus will be angry. All his pictures show signs of the superior and
celebrated city gentleman, who has only gone into the country to interest
himself in the study of civilisation: there he hunts after effectively comical
features, and, having arranged his little world in <i>tableaux vivants</i>, he coolly
surrenders it to the derision of the cultivated spectator.</p>

<p>But such a judgment, which seems like a condemnation, could not be
maintained from the historical standpoint. Germany could not forget
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>198</span>
Knaus, if it were only for the fact that in the fifties he sided with those who
first spread the unusual opinion that painting was incomprehensible without
sound ability in the matter of colour. He was not content, like the elder
generation, to arrange the individual characters in his pictures in well-disposed
groups. He took care to make his works faultless in colouring, so that in
the fifties he not only roused the enthusiasm of the great public by his &ldquo;poetic
invention,&rdquo; but made even the Parisian painters enthusiastic by his easy
mastery of technique.</p>

<p>To the following effect wrote Edmond About in 1855: &ldquo;I do not know
whether Herr Knaus has long nails; but even if they were as long as those
of Mephistopheles, I should still say that he was an artist to his fingers&rsquo; ends.
His pictures please the Sunday public and the Friday public, the critics, the
<i>bourgeois</i>, and (God forgive me!) the painters. What is seductive to the
great multitude is the clearly expressed dramatic idea, while artists and
connoisseurs are won by his knowledge and thorough ability. Herr Knaus
has the capacity of satisfying every one. His pictures attract the most incompetent
eyes, because they tell pleasant anecdotes; but they likewise
fascinate the most jaded by perfect execution of detail. The whole talent
of Germany is contained in the person of Herr Knaus. So Germany lives
in the Rue de l&rsquo;Arcade in Paris.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the fifties all the technical ability which was to be gained from the
study of the old Dutch masters and from constant commerce with the modern
French reached its highest point in Knaus. Even in his youth the great
Netherlandish painters, Ostade, Brouwer, and Teniers, must have had more
effect upon him than his teachers, Sohn and Schadow, since his very first
pictures, &ldquo;The Peasants&rsquo; Dance&rdquo; of 1850 and &ldquo;The Card Sharpers&rdquo; of
1850, had little in common with the Düsseldorf school, and therefore so much
the more with the Netherlandish <i>chiaroscuro</i>. &ldquo;The Card Sharpers&rdquo; is
precisely like an Ostade modernised. By his migration to Paris in 1852
he sought to acquire the utmost perfection of finish; and when he returned
home, after a sojourn of eight years, he had at his command such a sense for
effect and fine harmony of tone, such a knowledge of colour, and such a disciplined
and refined taste, that his works indicate an immeasurable advance
on the motley harshness of his predecessors. His &ldquo;Golden Wedding&rdquo; of
1858&mdash;perhaps his finest picture&mdash;had nothing of the antiquated technique
of the older type of Düsseldorf pictures of peasant life; technically it stood on
a level with the works of the French.</p>

<p>And Knaus has remained the same ever since: a separate personality
which belongs to history. He painted peasant pictures of tragic import and
rustic gaiety; he recognised a number of graceful traits in child-life, and,
having seen a great deal of the world, he made a transition, after he had
settled in Berlin, from the character picture of the Black Forest to such as
may be painted from the life of cities. He even ventured to touch on religious
subjects, and taught the world the limitations of his talent by his &ldquo;Holy
Families,&rdquo; composed out of reminiscences of all times and all schools, and by
his &ldquo;Daniel in the Lions&rsquo; Den.&rdquo; Knaus is whole-heartedly a <i>genre</i> painter;
though that, indeed, is what he has in common with many other people. But
thirty years ago he had a genius for colour amid a crowd of narrative and
character painters, and this makes him unique. He is a man whose significance
does not merely lie in his talent for narrative, but one who did much
for German art. It may be said that in giving the <i>genre</i> picture unsuspected
subtleties of colour he helped German art to pass from mere <i>genre</i> painting
to painting pure and simple. In this sense he filled an artistic mission, and
won for himself in the history of modern painting a firm and sure place, which
even the opponent of the illustrative vignette cannot take from him.</p>

<p><i>Vautier</i>, who must always be named in the same breath with Knaus, is
in truth the exact opposite of the Berlin master. He also is essentially a <i>genre</i>
painter, and his pictures should not be merely seen but studied in detail; but
where Knaus has merits Vautier is defective, and where Knaus is jarring
Vautier has merits. In technique he cannot boast of similar qualities. He
is always merely a draughtsman who tints, but has never been a colourist.
As a painter he has less value, but as a <i>genre</i> painter he is more sympathetic.
In the pictures of Knaus one is annoyed by the deliberate smirk, by his exaggerated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>202</span>
and heartlessly frigid observation. Vautier gives pleasure by characterisation,
more delicately reserved in its adjustment of means, and profound as
it is simple, by his wealth of individual motives and their charm, and by the
sensitiveness with which he renders the feelings and relationship of his figures.
A naïve, good-humoured, and amiable temperament is betrayed in his works.
He is genially idyllic where Knaus creates a pungently satirical effect, and a
glance at the portraits of the two men explains this difference.</p>

<table class="flt" style="float: right; width: 490px;" summary="Illustration">

<tr><td class="caption">BENJAMIN VAUTIER.</td></tr></table>

<p>Knaus with his puckered forehead, and his searching look shooting from
under heavy brows, is like a judge or a public prosecutor. Vautier, with his
thoughtful blue eyes, resembles a prosperous banker with a turn for idealism,
or a writer of village tales <i>à la</i> Berthold Auerbach. Knaus worried himself
over many things, brooded much and made many experiments; Vautier was
content with the acquisition of a plain and simple method of painting, which
appeared to him a perfectly sufficient medium for the expression of that which
he had realised with profound emotion. The one is a reflective and the other
a dreamy nature. Vautier was a man of a happy temperament, one with
whom the world went well from his youth upwards, who enjoyed an existence
free from care, and who had accustomed himself as a painter to see the world
in a rosy light. There is something sound and pure in his characters, in his
pictures something peaceful and cordial; it does not, indeed, make his paltry
pedantic style of painting any
the better, but from the human
standpoint it touches one sympathetically.
His countrymen
may be ashamed of Vautier
as a painter when they come
across him amongst aliens in
foreign exhibitions, but they
rejoice in him none the less as
a <i>genre</i> painter. It is as if
they had been met by the quiet,
faithful gaze of a German eye
amid the fiery glances of the
Latin nations. It is as if
they suddenly heard a simple
German song, rendered without
training, and yet with a great
deal of feeling. A generation
ago Knaus could exhibit everywhere
as a painter; as such
Vautier was only possible in
Germany during the sixties.
But in Knaus it is impossible
to get rid of the impress of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>203</span>
the Berlin professor, while from Vautier&rsquo;s pictures there smiles the kindly
sentiment of German home-life. Vautier&rsquo;s world, no doubt, is as one-sided
as that of old Meyerheim. His talkative Paul Prys, his brides with
their modest shyness, his smart young fellows throwing amorous glances,
his proud fathers, and his sorrow-stricken mothers are, it may be, types rather
than beings breathing positive and individual life. Such a golden radiance
of grace surrounds the pretty figures of his bare-footed rustic maidens as
never pertained to those of the real world, but belongs rather to the shepherdess
of a fairy tale who marries the prince. His figures must not be measured
by the standard of realistic truth to nature. But they are the inhabitants
of a dear, familiar world in which everything breathes of prettiness and lovable
good-humour. It is almost touching to see with what purity and beauty
life is reflected in Vautier&rsquo;s mind.</p>

<p>How dainty are these brown-eyed Swabian peasant girls, how tender and
sympathetic the women, and how clean and well-behaved the children! You
could believe that Vautier mixed with his peasants like a friend or a benevolent
god-father, that he delighted in their harmless pleasures, that he took part
in their griefs and cares. In his pictures he does not give an account of his
impressions with severity or any deliberate attempt to amuse, but with indulgence
and cordiality. It is not his design to excite or to thrill, to waken
comedy through whimsicalities or mournfulness by anything tragical. Life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>204</span>
reveals to him &ldquo;merely pleasant things,&rdquo; as it did to Goethe during his tour
in Italy, and even in its tragedies only people &ldquo;who bear the inevitable with
dignity.&rdquo; He never expressed boisterous grief: everything is subdued, and
has that tenderness which is associated with the mere sound of his Christian
name, Benjamin. Knaus has something of Menzel, Vautier of Memlinc: he
has it even in the loving familiarity with which he penetrates minute detail.
In their religious pictures the old German and Netherlandish masters painted
everything, down to the lilies worked on the Virgin&rsquo;s loom, or the dust lying
on the old service-book; and this thoroughly German delight in still life, this
complacent rendering of minutiæ, is found again in Vautier.</p>

<p>Men and their dwellings, animated nature and atmosphere, combine to
make a pleasant world in his pictures. Vautier was one of the first to discover
the magic of environment, the secret influence which unites a man to the soil
from which he sprang, the thousand unknown, magnetic associations existing
between outward things and the spirit, between the intuitions and the actions
of man. The environment is not there like a stage scene in front of which
the personages come and go; it lives and moves in the man himself. One
feels at home in these snug and cosy rooms, where the Black Forest clock is
ticking, where little, tasteless photographs look down from the wall with an
honest, patriarchal air, where the floor is scoured so clean, and greasy green
hats hang on splendid antlers. There is the great family bed with the flowered
curtains, the massive immovable bench by the stove, the solid old table,
around which young and old assemble at meal-times. There are the great
cupboards for the treasures of the house, the prayer-book given to grandmother
at her confirmation, the filigree ornaments, the glasses and coffee-cups,
which are kept for show, not for daily use. Over the bedstead are hung the
little pictures of saints painted on glass, and the consecrated tokens. From
the window one overlooks other appurtenances of the house; gaudy scarlet
runners clamber in from the little garden, blossoming fruit-trees stand in its
midst, and the gable of the well-filled barn rises above it. Everything has
an air of peace and prosperity, the mood of a Sunday forenoon; one almost
fancies that one can catch the chime of the distant church bells through the
blissful stillness. But completeness of effect and pictorial harmony are not
to be demanded: the illustrated paper is better suited to his style than the
exhibition.</p>

<p>The third member of the alliance is <i>Franz Defregger</i>, a man of splendid
talent; of all the masters of the great Munich school of Piloty, he is at once
the simplest and the healthiest. True it is, no doubt, that when posterity
sifts and weighs his works, much of him, also, will be found too light. Defregger&rsquo;s
art has suffered from his fame and from the temptations of the
picture market. Moreover, he had not Vautier&rsquo;s fine sense of the limitations
of his ability, but often represented things which he did not understand.
He was less of a painter than any of the artists of Piloty&rsquo;s school, and more
completely tethered by the size of his picture. He could not go beyond a
certain space of canvas without suffering for it; and he bound his talent
on the bed of Procrustes when he attempted to paint Madonnas, or placed
himself with his Hofer pictures in the rank of historical painters. But as a
<i>genre</i> painter he stands beside Vautier, in the first line; and by these little
<i>genre</i> pictures&mdash;the simpler and quieter the better&mdash;and some of his genially
conceived and charming portrait studies, he will survive. Those are things
which he understood and felt. He had himself lived amid the life he depicted,
and so it was that what he depicted made such a powerful appeal to the heart.</p>

<p>The year 1869 made him known. The Munich Exhibition had in that
year a picture on a subject from the history of the Hofer rising of 1809. It
represented how the little son of Speckbacher, one of the Tyrolese leaders,
had come after his father, armed with a musket; and at the side of an old
forester he is entering the room in which Speckbacher is just holding a council
of war. The father springs up angry at his disobedience, but also proud of
the little fellow&rsquo;s pluck. From this time Defregger&rsquo;s art was almost entirely
devoted to the Tyrolese people. To paint the smart lads and neat lasses of
Tyrol in joy and sorrow, love and hate, at work and merry-making, at home
or outside on the mountain pasture, in all their beauty, strength, and robust
health, was the life-long task for which he more than any other man had been
created. He had, over Knaus
and most other painters of
village tales, the enormous
advantage of not standing
personally outside or above
the people, and not regarding
them with the superficial
curiosity of a tourist&mdash;for he
belonged to them himself.
Others, if ironically disposed,
saw in the rustic the stupid,
comic peasant; or, if inclined
to sentimentalism, introduced
into the rural world the
moods and feelings of
&ldquo;society,&rdquo; traits of drawing-room
sensitiveness, the heavy
air of the town. Models
in national costume were
grouped for pictures of Upper
Bavarian rustic life. But Defregger,
who up to the age of
fifteen had kept his father&rsquo;s
cattle on the pastures of the
Ederhof, had shared the joys
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>208</span>
and sorrows of the peasantry long enough to know that they are neither
comic nor sentimental people.</p>

<p>The roomy old farmhouse where he was born in 1835 lay isolated amid
the wild mountains. He went about bare-footed and bare-headed, waded
through deep snow when he made his way to school in winter, and wandered
about amid the highland pastures with the flocks in summer. Milkmaids
and wood-cutters, hunters and cowherds, were his only companions. At
fifteen he was the head labourer of the estate, helped to thresh the corn, and
worked on the arable land and in the stable and the barn like others. When
he was twenty-three he lost his father and took over the farm himself: he
was thus a man in the full sense of the word before his artistic calling was
revealed to him. And this explains his qualities and defects. When he
came to Piloty after the sale of his farm and his aimless sojourn in Innsbruck
and Paris he was mature in mind; he was haunted by the impressions of his
youth, and he wanted to represent the land and the people of Tyrol. But he
was too old to become a good &ldquo;painter.&rdquo; On the other hand, he possessed
the great advantage of knowing what he wanted. The heroes of history did
not interest him; it was only the Tyrolese woodmen who persisted in his brain.
He left Piloty&rsquo;s studio almost as he had entered it&mdash;awkward, and painting
heavily and laboriously, and but very little impressed by Piloty&rsquo;s theatrical
sentiment. His youth and his recollections were rooted in the life of the
people; and with a faithful eye
he caught earnest or cheerful
phases of that life, and represented
them simply and cordially:
and if he had had the
strength to offer a yet more
effectual resistance to the prevalent
ideal of beauty, there is no
doubt that his stories would
seem even more fresh and
vigorous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Dance&rdquo; was the first
picture which followed that of
&ldquo;Speckbacher,&rdquo; and it was circulated
through the world in
thousands of reproductions.
There are two delightful figures
in it: the pretty milkmaid who
looks around her, radiant with
pleasure, and the wiry old Tyrolese
who is lifting his foot, cased
in a rough hobnail shoe, to dance
to the <i>Schuhplattler</i>. At the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>209</span>
time he painted &ldquo;The Prize Horse&rdquo; returning to his native village from the
show decked and garlanded and greeted exultantly by old and young as the
pride of the place. &ldquo;The Last Summons&rdquo; was again a scene from the Tyrolese
popular rising of 1809. All who can still carry a rifle, a scythe, or a pitchfork
have enrolled themselves beneath the banners, and are marching out to battle
over the rough village street. The wives and children are looking earnestly
at the departing figures, whilst a little old woman is pressing her husband&rsquo;s
hand. Everything was simply and genially rendered without sentimentality
or emphasis, and the picture even makes an appeal by its colouring. As a
sequel &ldquo;The Return of the Victors&rdquo; was produced in 1876: a troop of the
Tyrolese levy is marching through its native mountain village, with a young
peasant in advance, slightly wounded, and looking boldly round. Tyrolese
banners are waving, and the fifes and drums and clarionet players bring up
the rear. The faces of the men beam with the joy of victory, and women
and children stand around to welcome those returning home. Joy, however,
is harder to paint faithfully than sorrow. It is so easy to see that it has been
artificially worked up from the model; nor is Defregger&rsquo;s picture entirely
innocent on this charge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Andreas Hofer going to his Death&rdquo; was his first concession to Piloty.
Defregger had become professor at the Munich Academy, and was entered
in the directory as &ldquo;historical painter.&rdquo; The figures were therefore painted
life size; and in the grouping and the choice of the &ldquo;psychic moment&rdquo; the
style aimed at &ldquo;grand painting.&rdquo; The result was the same emptiness which
blusters through the historical pictures of the school of Delaroche, Gallait,
and Piloty. The familiar stage effect and stilted passion has taken the place
of simple and easy naturalism. Nor was he able to give life to the great
figures of a large canvas as he had done in the smaller picture of the &ldquo;Return
of the Victors.&rdquo; This is true of &ldquo;The Peasant Muster&rdquo; of 1883&mdash;which
represented the Tyrolese, assembled in an arms manufactory, learning that
the moment for striking had arrived&mdash;and of the last picture of the series,
&ldquo;Andreas Hofer receiving the Presents of the Emperor Francis in the Fortress
of Innsbruck.&rdquo; All the great Hofer pictures, which in earlier days were
honoured as his best performances, have done less for his memory than for
that of the sturdy hero. The <i>genre</i> picture was Defregger&rsquo;s vocation. There
lay his strength, and as soon as he left that province he renounced his fine
qualities.</p>

<p>And a holiday humour, a tendency to beautify what he saw, is spread
over even his <i>genre</i> pictures. They make one suppose that there is always
sunshine in the happy land of Tyrol, that all the people are chaste and beautiful,
all the young fellows fine and handsome, all the girls smart, every household
cleanly and well-ordered, all married folk and children honest and kind;
whereas in reality these milk-maids and woodmen are far less romantic in their
conduct; and so many a townsman who avoids contact with the living people
goes into raptures over them as they are pictures. With Vautier he shares
this one-sidedness as well as his defective colour. Almost all his pictures
are hard, dry, and diffident in colouring, but, as with Vautier, the man atones
for the painter. From Defregger one asks for no qualities of colour and no
realistic Tyrolese, since he has rendered himself in his pictures, and gives one
a glimpse into his own heart; and a healthy, genial, and kindly heart it is.
His idealism is not born of laboriously acquired principles of beauty; it expresses
the temperament of a painter&mdash;a temperament which unconsciously
sees the people through a medium whereby they are glorified. A rosy glow
obscures sadness, ugliness, wretchedness, and misery, and shows only strength
and health, tenderness and beauty, fidelity and courage. He treasured
sunny memories of the cheerful radiance which rested on his home in the
hour of his return; he painted the joy which swelled in his own breast as he
beheld again the rocks of his native country, heard once more the peaceful
chime of its Sabbath bells. And this is what gives his works their human,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>214</span>
inward truth, little as they may be authentic documents as to the population
of Tyrol.</p>

<p>Later this will be more impartially recognised than it possibly can be at
present. The larger the school of any artist, the more it will make his art
trivial; and thus for a time the originality of the master himself seems to be
mere trifling. The Tyrolese were depreciated in the market by Defregger&rsquo;s
imitators; only too many have aped his painting of stiff leather breeches
and woollen bodices, without putting inside them the vivid humanity which
is so charming in a genuine Defregger. But his position in the history of art
is not injured by this. He has done enough for his age; he has touched the
hearts of many by his cheerful, fresh, and healthy art, and he would be certain
of immortality had he thrown aside his brush altogether from the time when
the progress of painting left him in the rear.</p>

<p>With Defregger, the head of the Tyrolese school, Gabl and Mathias Schmidt,
standing at a measurable distance from him, may find a well-merited place.
<i>Mathias Schmidt</i>, born in the Tyrolese Alps in the same year as Defregger,
began with satirical representations of the local priesthood. A poor image-carver
has arrived with his waggon at an inn, on the terrace of which are
sitting a couple of well-fed ecclesiastics, and by them he is ironically called to
account as he offers a crucifix for sale. A young priest, as an austere judge
of morals, reproves a pair of lovers who are standing before him, or asks
a young girl such insidious questions at the bridal examination that she
lowers her eyes, blushing. His greatest picture was &ldquo;The Emigration of
the Zillerthal Protestants.&rdquo; Amongst later works, without controversial
tendencies, &ldquo;The Hunter&rsquo;s Greeting&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Lathered Parson&rdquo; may
be named. The latter is surprised by two pretty girls while shaving. To
these may be added &ldquo;The Parson&rsquo;s Patch,&rdquo; a picture of a robust housekeeper
hastily mending a weak spot in the pastor&rsquo;s inexpressibles just before
service.</p>

<p>Shortly after Defregger had painted his picture of &ldquo;Speckbacher,&rdquo; <i>Alois
Gabl</i> came forward with his &ldquo;Haspinger preaching Revolt,&rdquo; and followed it
up by smaller pictures with a humorous touch, representing a levy of recruits
in Tyrol, the dance at the inn interrupted by the entrance of the parson,
magnates umpiring at the shooting butts, a bar with laughing girls, and the
like.</p>

<p>In 1870, <i>Eduard Kurzbauer</i>, who died young, in his &ldquo;Fugitives Overtaken&rdquo;
executed a work representing an entire class of painted illustrations. A young
man who has eloped with a girl is discovered with her by her mother in a
village inn. The old lady is looking reproachfully at her daughter, who is
overwhelmed by shame and penitence; the young man is much moved, the
old servant grave and respectful, the young landlady curious, and the postilion
who has driven the eloping pair has a sly smirk. Elsewhere Kurzbauer, who
is a fresh and lively anecdotist, painted principally episodes, arraying his
figures in the peasant garb of the Black Forest: a rejected suitor takes a sad
farewell of a perverse blonde who disdains his love; or the engagement of two
lovers is hindered by the interference of the father.</p>

<p><i>Hugo Kauffmann</i>, the son of Hermann Kauffmann, planted himself in the
interior of village taverns or in front of them, and made his dressed-up models
figure as hunters, telling incredible tales, dancing to the fiddle, or quarrelling
over cards.</p>

<p>Another North German, <i>Wilhelm Riefstahl</i>, showed how the peasants in
Appenzell or Bregenz conduct themselves at mournful gatherings, at their
devotions in the open air, and at All Souls&rsquo; Day Celebrations, and afterwards
extended his artistic dominion over Rügen, Westphalia, and the Rhine country
with true Mecklenburg thoroughness. He was a careful, conscientious worker,
with a discontent at his own efforts in his composition, a certain ponderousness
in his attempts at <i>genre</i>; but his diligently executed pictures&mdash;full of
colour and painted in a peculiarly German manner&mdash;are highly prized in
public galleries on account of their instructive soundness.</p>

<p>After the various classes of the German peasantry had been naturalised
in the picture market by these narrative painters, <i>Eduard Grützner</i>, when
religious controversy raged in the seventies, turned aside to discover drolleries
in monastic life. This he did with the assistance of brown and yellowish
white cowls, and the obese and copper-nosed models thereto pertaining. He
depicts how the cellarer tastes a new wine, and the rest of the company await
his verdict with anxiety; how the entire monastery is employed at the vintage,
at the broaching of a wine cask or the brewing of the beer; how they tipple;
how bored they are over their chess or their dice, their cards or their dominoes;
how they whitewash old frescoes or search after forbidden books in the monastery
library. This, according to Grützner, is the routine in which the life of
monks revolves. At times amidst these figures appear foresters who tell of
their adventures in the chase, or deliver hares at the cloister kitchen. And
the more Grützner was forced year after year to make up for his decline as a
colourist, by cramming his pictures with so-called humour, the greater was
his success.</p>

<p>It was only long afterwards that <i>genre</i> painting in broad-cloth came into
vogue by the side of this <i>genre</i> in peasant blouse and monastic cowl, and stories
of the exchange and the manufactory by the side of village and monastic
tales. Here Düsseldorf plays a part once more in the development of art.
The neighbourhood of the great manufacturing towns on the Rhine could
not but lead painters to these subjects. <i>Ludwig Bokelmann</i>, who began by
painting tragical domestic scenes&mdash;card players, and smoking shop-boys, in
the style of Knaus&mdash;made the pawnshop a theme for art in 1875, and dexterously
crowded into his picture all the types which popular fancy brings into association
with the conception: business-like indifference, poverty ashamed, fallen
prosperity, bitter need, avarice, and the love of pleasure. In 1877, when
the failure of the house of Spitzeder made a sensation in the papers, he painted
his picture &ldquo;The Savings Bank before the Announcement of Failure,&rdquo; which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>218</span>
gave him another opportunity for ranging in front of the splendid building
an assembly of deluded creditors of all classes, and of showing how they expressed
their emotion according to temperament and education, by excited
speeches, embittered countenances, gloomy resignation, or vivid gesticulation.
Much attention was likewise excited by &ldquo;The Arrest.&rdquo; In this picture a
woman was being watched for by a policeman, whilst the neighbours&mdash;male
and female&mdash;loitered round with the requisite expression of horror, indignation,
sympathy, or indifferent curiosity. The opening of a will, the last moments
of an electioneering struggle, scenes in the entrance hall of a court of justice,
the emigrants&rsquo; farewell, the gaming-table at Monte Carlo, and a village fire,
were other newspaper episodes from the life of great towns which he rendered
in paint.</p>

<p>His earlier associate in Düsseldorf, <i>Ferdinand Brütt</i>, after first painting
<i>rococo</i> pictures, owed his finest successes to the Stock Exchange. It, too,
had its types: the great patrician merchants and bankers of solid reputation,
the jobbers, break-neck speculators, and decayed old stagers; and, as Brütt
rendered these current figures in a very intelligible manner, his pictures excited
a great deal of attention. Acquittals and condemnations, acts of mortgage,
emigration agents, comic electors, and prison visits, as further episodes
from the social, political, and commercial life of great towns, fill up the odd
corners of his little local chronicle.</p>

<p>Thus the German <i>genre</i> painting ran approximately the same course as
the English had done at the beginning of the century. At that time the
kingdom of German art was not of this world. Classicism taught men to
turn their eyes on the art of a past age. Art in Germany had progressed
slowly, and at first with an uncertain and hesitating step, before it learnt
that what blossoms here, and thrives and fades, should be the subject of its
labours. Gradually it brought one sphere of reality after the other into its
domain. Observation took the place of abstraction, and the discoverer that
of the inventor. The painter went amongst his fellow-creatures, opened his
eyes and his heart to share their fortunes and misfortunes, and to reproduce
them in his own creation. He discovered the peculiarities of grades of life
and professional classes. Every one of the beautiful German landscapes
with its peasantry, every one of the monastic orders and every manufacturing
town found its representative in <i>genre</i> painting. The country was mapped
out. Each one took over his plot, which he superintended, conscientiously,
like an ethnographical museum. And just as fifty years before, Germany
had been fertilised by England, so it now gave in its turn the principles of
<i>genre</i> painting to the powers of the second rank in art.</p>

<p>Even France was in some degree influenced. As if to indicate that Alsace
would soon become German once more, after 1850 there appeared in that
province certain painters who busied themselves with the narration of anecdote
from rustic life quite in the manner of Knaus and Vautier.</p>

<p><i>Gustave Brion</i>, the grand-nephew of Frederica of Sesenheim, settled in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>219</span>
the Vosges, and there gave intelligence of a little world whose life flowed by,
without toil, in gentle, patriarchal quietude, interrupted only by marriage
feasts, birthdays, and funeral solemnities. He appears to have been rather
fond of melancholy and solemn subjects. His interiors, with their sturdy
and honest people, bulky old furniture, and large green faïence stoves, which
are so dear to him, are delightful in their familiar homeliness and their cordial
Alsatian and German character, and recall Vautier; in fact, he might well be
termed the French Vautier. He lives in them himself&mdash;the quiet old man,
who in his last years occupied himself solely with the management of his
garden and the culture of flowers, or sat by the hour in an easy-chair at the
window telling stories to his old dog Putz. But pictorial unity of effect must
be asked from him as little as from Vautier.</p>

<p><i>Charles Marchal</i>, too, was no painter, but an anecdotist, with a bias towards
the humorous or sentimental; and so very refined and superior was
he that he saw none but pretty peasant girls, who might easily be mistaken
for &ldquo;young ladies,&rdquo; if they exchanged their kerchiefs and bodices for a
Parisian toilette. His chief picture was &ldquo;The Hiring Fair&rdquo; of 1864: pretty
peasant girls are standing in a row along the street, bargaining with prospective
masters before hiring themselves out.</p>

<p>The most famous of this group of artists is <i>Jules Breton</i>, who after various
humorous and sentimental pieces placed himself in 1853 in the front rank
of the French painters of
rustics by his &ldquo;Return of
the Reapers&rdquo; (Musée Luxembourg).
His &ldquo;Gleaners&rdquo;
in 1855, &ldquo;Blessing the
Fields&rdquo; in 1857, and &ldquo;The
Erection of the Picture of
Christ in the Churchyard&rdquo;
were pretty enough to please
the public, and sufficiently
sound in technique not to be
a stumbling-block to artists.
After 1861 he conceived an
enthusiasm for sunsets, and
was never weary of depicting
the hour when the fair forms
of peasant maidens stand
gracefully out against the
quiet golden horizon. Jules
Breton wrote many poems,
and a vein of poetry runs
through his pictures. They
tell of the sadness of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>220</span>
land when the fields sleep dreamily beneath the shadows of the evening,
touched by the last ray of the departing sun; but they tell of it in
verses where the same rhymes are repeated with wearisome monotony.
Breton is a charming and sympathetic figure, but he never quite conquered
Classicism. His gleaners moving across the field in the evening twilight bear
witness to an attentive, deliberate study of the works of Leopold Robert;
and unfortunately much of the emphasis and classical style of Robert has
been transmitted to Breton&rsquo;s rustic maidens. They have most decidedly a
lingering weakness for pose, and a sharp touch of the formula of the schools.
There is an affectation of style in their garb, and their hands are those of
<i>bonnes</i> who have never even handled a rake. Breton, as Millet said of him,
paints girls who are too beautiful to remain in the country. His art is a well-bred,
idyllic painting, with gilt edges; it is pleasing and full of delicate figures
which are always elegant and always correct, but it is a little like flat lemonade;
it is monotonous and only too carefully composed, destitute of all masculinity
and seldom avoiding the reef of affectation.</p>

<p>Norway and Sweden were fructified from Düsseldorf immediately. When
Tidemand had shown the way, the academy on the Rhine was the high school
for all the sons of the North during the fifties. They set to translating Knaus
and Vautier into Swedish and Norwegian, and caught the tone of their originals
so exactly that they almost seem more Düsseldorfian than the Düsseldorfers
themselves.</p>

<p><i>Karl D&rsquo;Uncker</i>, who arrived in 1851 and died in 1866, was led by the
influence of Vautier to turn to little humorous incidents. After &ldquo;The Two
Deaf Friends&rdquo; (two old people very hard of hearing, who are making comical
efforts to understand each other) and &ldquo;The Vagabond Musician and his
Daughter before the Village Magistrates&rdquo; there followed in 1858 the scene
in &ldquo;The Pawnshop,&rdquo; which divided the honours of the year with Knaus&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Golden Wedding.&rdquo; He is an artistic compromise between Knaus and
Schroedter, a keen observer and a humorous narrator, who takes special pleasure
in the sharp opposition of characteristic figures. In his &ldquo;Pawnshop&rdquo;
and his &ldquo;Third Class Waiting Room&rdquo; vagabonds mingle in the crowd beside
honest people, beggars beside retired tradesmen, old procuresses beside pure
and innocent girls, and heartless misers beside warm-hearted philanthropists.
In these satirically humorous little comedies Swedish costume has been rightly
left out of sight. This ethnographical element was the <i>forte of Bengt Nordenberg</i>,
who as a copyist of Tidemand gradually became the Riefstahl of the
North. His &ldquo;Golden Wedding in Blekingen,&rdquo; his &ldquo;Bridal Procession,&rdquo; his
&ldquo;Collection of Tithes,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Pietists,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Promenade at the Well,&rdquo;
are of the same ethnographical fidelity and the same anecdotic dryness. He
gets his best effects when he strikes an idyllic, childlike note or one of patriarchal
geniality. The &ldquo;Bridal Procession&rdquo; received in the village with salvoes
and music, &ldquo;The Newly Married Pair&rdquo; making a first visit to the parents
of one of them, the picture of schoolboys playing tricks upon an old organist,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>221</span>
that of children mourning
over a lamb slain by a wolf,
are, in the style of the sixties,
the works of a modest and
amiable anecdotist, who had
a fine sense for the peaceful,
familiar side of everyday life
in town and country.</p>

<p>In <i>Wilhelm Wallander</i>, as
in Madou, noise and frolic
and jest have the upper
hand. His pictures are like
saucy street ditties sung to a
barrel-organ. The crowd at
the market-place, the gossip
in the spinning-room on a
holiday evening, hop-pickings,
dances, auctions on old
estates, weddings, and the
guard turning out, are his
favourite scenes. Even when
he came to Düsseldorf he was
preceded by his fame as a
jolly fellow and a clever
draughtsman, and when he
exhibited his &ldquo;Market in
Vingaker&rdquo; he was greeted
as another Teniers. His
&ldquo;Hop-Harvest&rdquo; is like a
waxwork show of teasing lads
and laughing lasses. He was
an incisive humorist and a
spirited narrator, who under all circumstances was more inclined to jest
than to touch idyllic and elegiac chords. In his pictures peasant girls
never wander solitary across the country, for some lad who is passing by
always has a joke to crack with them; it never happens that girls sit lonely
by the hearth, there is always a lover to peep out laughing from behind the
cupboard door.</p>

<p><i>Anders Koskull</i> cultivated the <i>genre</i> picture of children in a more elegiac
fashion; he has poor people sitting in the sun, or peasant families in the Sunday
stillness laying wreaths upon the graves of their dear ones in the churchyard.
<i>Kilian Zoll</i>, like Meyer of Bremen, painted very childish pictures of women
spinning, children with cats, the joys of grandmother, and the like. <i>Peter
Eskilson</i> turned to the representation of an idyllic age of honest yeomen, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>222</span>
has given in his best known work, &ldquo;A Game of Skittles in Faggens,&rdquo; a pleasant
picture from peasant life in the age of pig-tails. The object of <i>August Jernberg&rsquo;s</i>
study was the Westphalian peasant with his slouching hat, long white coat,
flowered waistcoat, and large silver buttons. He was specially fond of painting
dancing bears surrounded by a crowd of amused spectators, or annual fairs,
for which a picturesque part of old Düsseldorf served as a background.
<i>Ferdinand Fagerlin</i> has something attractive in his simplicity and good-humour.
If he laughs, as he delights in doing, his laughter is cordial and
kind-hearted, and if he touches an elegiac chord he can guard against sentimentalism.
In contrast with D&rsquo;Uncker and Wallander, who always hunted
after character pieces, he devotes himself to expression with much feeling,
and interprets it delicately even in its finer <i>nuances</i>. Henry Ritter, who
influenced him powerfully in the beginning of his career, drew his attention
to Holland, and Fagerlin&rsquo;s quiet art harmonises with the Dutch phlegm.
Within the four walls of his fishermen&rsquo;s huts there are none but honest grey-beards
and quiet women, active wives and busy maidens, vigorous sailors and
lively peasant lads. But his pictures are sympathetic in spite of this one-sided
optimism, since the sentiment is not too affected nor the anecdotic points
too heavily underlined.</p>

<p>Amongst the Norwegians belonging to this group is <i>V. Stoltenberg-Lerche</i>,
who with the aid of appropriate accessories adapted the interiors of cloisters
and churches to <i>genre</i> pictures, such as &ldquo;Tithe Day in the Cloister,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Cloister Library,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Visit of a Cardinal to the Cloister,&rdquo; and so forth.
<i>Hans Dahl</i>, a <i>juste-milieu</i> between Tidemand and Emanuel Spitzer, carried
the Düsseldorf village idyll down to the present time. &ldquo;Knitting the Stocking&rdquo;
(girls knitting on the edge of a lake), &ldquo;Feminine Attraction&rdquo; (a lad with three
peasant maidens who are dragging a boat to shore in spite of his resistance),
&ldquo;A Child of Nature&rdquo; (a little girl engaged to sit as model to a painter amongst
the mountains, and running away in alarm), &ldquo;The Ladies&rsquo; Boarding School on
the Ice,&rdquo; &ldquo;First Pay Duty,&rdquo; etc., are some of the witty titles of his wares,
which are scattered over Europe and America. Everything is sunny, everything
laughs, the landscapes as well as the figures; and if Dahl had painted
fifty years ago, his fair maidens with heavy blond plaits, well-bred carriage,
and delicate hands that have never been disfigured by work, would undoubtedly
have assured him no unimportant place beside old Meyerheim in the history
of the development of the <i>genre</i> picture.</p>

<p>An offshoot from the Munich painting of rustics shot up into a vigorous
sapling in Hungary. The process of refining the raw talents of the Magyar
race had been perfected on the shores of the Isar, and the Hungarians showed
gratitude to their masters by applying the principles of the Munich <i>genre</i> to
Magyar subjects when they returned home. The Hungarian rooms of modern
exhibitions have consequently a very local impress. Everything seems
aboriginal, Magyar to the core, and purely national. Gipsies are playing
the fiddle and Hungarian national songs ring forth, acrobats exhibit, slender
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>223</span>
sons of Pusta sit in Hungarian village taverns over their tokay, muscular
peasant lads jest with buxom, black-eyed girls, smart hussars parade their
irresistible charms before lively damsels, and recruits endeavour to imbibe a
potent enthusiasm for the business of war from the juice of the grape. Stiff
peasants, limber gipsies, old people dancing, smart youths, the laughing
faces of girls and bold fellows with flashing eyes, quarrelsome heroes quick
with the knife, tipsy soldiers and swearing sergeants, drunkards, suffering
women and poor orphans, pawnshops and vagabonds, legal suits, electioneering
scenes, village tragedies and comic proposals, artful shop-boys, and criminals
condemned to death, the gay confusion of fairs and the merry return from
the harvest and the vintage, waxed moustaches, green and red caps and short
pipes, tokay, Banat wheat, Alfoeld tobacco, and Sarkad cattle,&mdash;such are the
elements worked up, as the occasion demanded, either into little tales or great
and thrilling romances. And the names of the painters are as thoroughly
Magyar as are the figures. Beside <i>Ludwig Ebner</i>, <i>Paul Boehm</i>, and <i>Otto von
Baditz</i>, which have a German sound, one comes across such names as <i>Koloman
Déry</i>, <i>Julius Aggházi</i>, <i>Alexander Bihari</i>, <i>Ignaz Ruskovics</i>, <i>Johann Jankó</i>,
<i>Tihamér Margitay</i>, <i>Paul Vagó</i>, <i>Arpad Fessty</i>, <i>Otto Koroknyai</i>, <i>D. Skuteczky</i>, etc.</p>

<p>But setting aside the altered names and the altered locality and garb,
the substance of these pictures is precisely the same as that of the Munich
pictures of twenty years before: dance and play, maternal happiness, wooing,
and the invitation to the wedding. Instead of the <i>Schuhplattler</i> they paint
the Czarda, instead of the drover&rsquo;s cottage the taverns of Pesth, instead of
the blue Bavarian uniform the green of the Magyar Hussars. Their painting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>224</span>
is tokay adulterated with Isar water, or Isar water with a flavour of tokay.
What seems national is at bottom only their antiquated standpoint. It is
a typical development repeating itself in the nineteenth century through
all branches of art; the sun rises in the West and sets in the East. Any
other progress than that of the gradual expansion of subject-matter cannot
be established in favour of the productions of all this <i>genre</i> painting. In
colour and in substance they represent a phase of art which the leading
countries of Europe had already left behind about the middle of the century,
and which had to be overcome elsewhere, if painting was again to be what
it had been in the old, good periods.</p>

<p>For as yet all these <i>genre</i> painters were the children of Hogarth; their
productions were the outcome of the same spirit, plebeian and alien to art,
which had come into painting when the middle classes began to hold a more
important position in society. Yet their artistic significance ought not to
be and cannot be contested. In an age which was prouder of its antiquarian
knowledge than of its own achievements, which recognised the faithful imitation
of the method of all past periods, the mere performance of a delicate
task, as the highest aim of art, these <i>genre</i> painters were the first to portray
the actual man of the nineteenth century; the first to desert museums and
appeal to nature, and thus to lay the foundation of modern painting. They
wandered in the country, looked at reality, sought to imitate it, and often
displayed in their studies a marvellous directness of insight. But these
vigorous initial studies were too modest to find favour and esteem with a public
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>225</span>
as yet insufficiently educated for the appreciation of art. Whilst in England
the exhibitions of the Royal Academy and in France those of the Paris Salon
created, comparatively early, a certain ground for the comprehension of art,
the <i>genre</i> painters of other countries worked up to and into the sixties without
the appropriate social combinations. After 1828 the Art Unions began to
usurp the position of that refined society which had formerly played the
Mæcenas as the leading dictators of taste.</p>

<p>Albrecht Adam, who was chiefly responsible for the foundation of the
Munich Union, has himself spoken clearly in his autobiography of the advantages
and disadvantages of this step. &ldquo;Often,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;often have I
asked myself whether I have done good or not by this scheme, and to this hour
I have not been able to make up my mind. The cultivation of art clearly
received an entirely different bias from that which it had in earlier days.
What was formerly done by artistic and judicious connoisseurs was now placed
for the most part in the hands of the people. Like so much else in the world,
that had its advantages, but in practice the shady side of the matter became
very obvious.&rdquo; The disadvantages were specially these: &ldquo;the people&rdquo; for
a long time could only understand such paintings as represented a story in
a broad and easy fashion; paintings which in the narrative cohesion of the
subject represented might be read off at a glance, since the mere art of reading
had been learnt at school, rather than those which deserved and required
careful study. The demand for anecdotic subject was only waived in the
case of ethnographical painting, in Italian and Oriental <i>genre</i>; for here the
singular types, pictorial costumes, and peculiar customs of foreign countries
were in themselves enough to provoke curiosity. What was prized in the picture
was merely something external, the subject of representation, not the representation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>226</span>
itself, the matter and not
the manner, that which concerned the
theme, that which fell entirely beyond
the province of art. The illustrated
periodicals which had been making
their appearance since the forties
gave a further impetus to this phase
of taste. The more inducement there
was to guess charades, the more injury
was done to the sensuous enjoyment
of art; for the accompanying
text of the author merely translated
the pictures back into their natural
element. Painters, however, were not
unwilling to reconcile themselves to
the circumstances, because, as a result
of their technical insufficiency, they
were forced, on their side, to try to
lend their pictures the adjunct of
superficial interest by anecdotic additions.
Literary humour had to serve
the purpose of pictorial humour, and
the talent of the narrator was necessary
to make up for their inadequate
artistic qualities. As the historical
painters conveyed the knowledge of
history in a popular style, the <i>genre</i>
painters set up as agreeable tattlers,
excellent anecdotists: they were in
turn droll, meditative, sentimental, and pathetic, but they were not
painters.</p>

<p>And painters, under these conditions, they could not possibly become. For
though it is often urged in older books on the history of art that modern <i>genre</i>
painting far outstripped the old Dutch <i>genre</i> in incisiveness of characterisation,
depth of psychological conception, and opulence of invention, these merits
are bought at the expense of all pictorial harmony. In the days of Rembrandt
the Dutch were painters to their fingers&rsquo; ends, and they were able to be so
because they appealed to a public whose taste was adequately trained to take
a refined pleasure in the contemplation of works of art which had sterling merits
of colour. Mieris painted the voluptuous ruffling of silken stuffs; Van der
Meer, the mild light stealing through little windows into quiet chambers, and
playing upon burnished vessels of copper and pewter, on majolica dishes and
silver chattels, on chests and coverings; De Hoogh, the sunbeam streaming
like a golden shaft of dust from some bright lateral space into a darker ante-chamber.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>227</span>
Each one set before himself different problems, and each ran
through an artistic course of development.</p>

<p>The more recent masters are mature from their first appearance; the
Hungarians paint exactly like the Swedes and the Germans, and their pictures
have ideas for the theme, but never such as are purely artistic. Like simple
woodland birds, they sing melodies which are, in some ways, exceedingly
pretty; but their plumage is not equal to their song. No man can be painter
and <i>genre</i> painter at the same time. The principal difference between them
is this: a painter sees his picture, rather than what may be extracted from it
by thought; the <i>genre</i> painter, on the other hand, has an idea in his mind, an
&ldquo;invention,&rdquo; and plans out a picture for its expression. The painter does not
trouble his head about the subject and the narrative contents; his poetry lies
in the kingdom of colour. There reigns in his works&mdash;take Brouwer, for
example&mdash;an authentic, uniformly plastic, and penetrative life welling from
the artist&rsquo;s soul. But the leading motive for the <i>genre</i> painter is the subject
as such. For example, he will paint a children&rsquo;s festival precisely because
it is a children&rsquo;s festival. But one must be a Jan Steen to accomplish
such a task in a soundly artistic manner. The observation of these more
recent painters meanwhile ventured no further than detail, and did not
know what to do with the
picture as a whole. They
got over their difficulties
because they &ldquo;invented&rdquo; the
scene, made the children pose
in the places required by the
situation, and then composed
these studies. The end was
accomplished when the leading
heroes of the piece had
been characterised and the
others well traced. The
colouring was merely an unessential
adjunct, and in a
purely artistic sense not at all
possible. For a picture which
has come into being through
a piecing together from separate
copies of set models, and
of costumes, vessels, interiors,
etc., may be ever so true to
nature in details, but this
mosaic work is bound systematically
to destroy the pictorial
appearance, unity, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>228</span>
quietude of the whole. Knaus is perhaps the only one who, as a fine connoisseur
of colour, concealed this scrap-book drudgery, and achieved a certain
congruity of colour in a really artistic manner by a subtilised method of
harmony. But as regards the pictures of all the others, it is clear at once that,
as Heine wrote, &ldquo;they have been rather edited than painted.&rdquo; The effectiveness
of the picture was lost in the detail, and even the truth of detail was
lost in the end in the opulence of subject, seductive as that was upon the first
glance. For, as it was held that the incident subjected to treatment&mdash;the more
circumstantial the better&mdash;ought to be mirrored through all grades and variations
of emotion in the faces, in the gestures of a family, of the gossips, of the
neighbours, of the public in the street, the inevitable consequence was that
the artist, to make himself understood, was invariably driven to exaggerate
the characterisation, and to set in the place of the unconstrained expression
of nature that which has been histrionically drilled into the model. Not less
did the attempt to unite these set figures as a composition in one frame lead
to an intolerable stencilling. The rules derived from historical painting in a
time dominated by that form of art were applied to our chequered and many-sided
modern life. Since the structure of this composition prescribed laws
from which the undesigned manifestation of individual objects is free, the
studies after nature had to be readjusted in the picture according to necessity.
There were attitudes in a conventional sense beautiful, but unnatural and
strained, and therefore creating an unpleasing effect. An arbitrary construction,
a forced method of composition, usurped the place of what was flexible,
various, and apparently casual. The painters did not fit the separate part as
it really was into the totality which the coherence of life demands: they
arranged scenes of comedy out of realistic elements just as a stage manager
would put them together.</p>

<p>And this indicates the further course which development was obliged to
take. When Hogarth was left behind, painting had once more gained the
independence which it had had in the great periods of art. The painter was
forced to cease from treating secondary qualities&mdash;such as humour and
narrative power&mdash;as though they were of the first account; and the public
had to begin to understand pictures as paintings and not as painted stories.
An &ldquo;empty subject&rdquo; well painted is to be preferred to an &ldquo;interesting theme&rdquo;
badly painted. Pictures of life must drive out <i>tableaux vivants</i>, and human
beings dislodge character types which curiosity renders attractive. Rather
let there be a moment of breathing reality rendered by purely artistic means
of expression than the most complete village tale defectively narrated; rather
the simplest figure rendered with actuality and no thought of self than the
most suggestive and ingenious characterisation. A conception, coloured by
the temperament of the artist, of what was simple and inartificial, expressing
nature at every step, had to take the place of laborious composition crowded
with figures, the plainness and truth of sterling art to overcome what was
overloaded and arbitrary, and the fragment of nature seized with spontaneous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>229</span>
freshness to supplant episodes put together out of fragmentary observations.
Only such painting as confined itself, like that of the Dutch, &ldquo;to the bare
empirical observation of surrounding reality,&rdquo; renouncing literary byplay,
spirited anecdotic fancies, and all those rules of beauty which enslave nature,
could really become the basis of modern art: and this the landscape painters
created. When once these masters resolved to paint from nature, and no
longer from their inner consciousness, there inevitably came a day when some
one amongst them wished to place in the field or the forest, which he had
painted after nature, a figure, and then felt the necessity of bringing that
figure into his picture just as he had seen it, without giving it an anecdote
mission or forcing it arbitrarily into his compositions. The landscapist found
the woodcutter in the forest, and the woodcutter seemed to him the ideal he
was seeking; the peasant seemed to him to have the right to stand amid the
furrows he had traced with his plough. He no longer drove the fisher and
the sailor from their barks, and had no scruple in representing the good
peasant woman, laden with wood, striding forwards in his picture just as she
strode through the forest. And so entry was made into the way of simplicity;
the top-heavy burden of interesting subject-matter was thrown aside, and the
truth of figures and environments was gained. The age contained all the
conditions for bringing landscape painting such as this to maturity.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">That</span> landscape would become for the nineteenth century even more
important than it was for the Holland of the seventeenth century had
been clearly announced since the days of Watteau and Gainsborough, and
since this tendency, in spite of all coercive rules, could be only momentarily
delayed by Classicism, it came to pass that the era which began with Winckelmann&rsquo;s
conception of &ldquo;vulgar nature&rdquo; ended a generation later with her
apotheosis. The thirty years from 1780 to 1810 denoted no more than a brief
imprisonment for modern landscape, the luxuriantly blooming child being
arbitrarily confined meanwhile in the strait-waistcoat of history. At first
the phrase of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, which declared that landscape was
no subject for painting because it had no soul, held painters altogether back
from injuring their reputation by such pictures. And when, after the close
of the century, some amongst them overcame this dread, Poussin the Classicist
was of course set up as the only model. For an age which did not paint men
but only statues, nature was too natural. As the figure painter subordinated
everything to style and moulded the human body accordingly, landscape
became mannered to suit an historical idea, and was used merely as a theatrical
background for Greek tragedies. As the draughtsmen of the age freed the
human figure from all &ldquo;individual blemishes,&rdquo; and thereby abandoned the
most essential points of life and credibility which are bound up with personality,
the landscapists wished to purify nature from everything &ldquo;accidental,&rdquo; with
the result that dreary commonplaces were produced from her, the infinitely
manifold. As the former sought the chief merit of their works in &ldquo;well-balanced
composition,&rdquo; the latter regarded trees and mountains, temples
and palaces, clouds and rivers, merely as counters which only needed to be
changed in their mutual position according to acquired rules of composition
to make new pictures. They did not reflect that nature possesses a more
original force than the most able self-conscious work of man, or, as Ludwig
Richter has so well expressed it, that &ldquo;what God Almighty has made is
always more beautiful than what men can invent.&rdquo; There were summary
rules for landscapes in the Poussin style, the beauty of which was sought
above all in an opulent play of noble lines, corresponding to the fine and
flowing lines of Carstens&rsquo; figures. But the conception was all the more pedantic
whilst the drawing was hard and dry and the colour feeble and vitreous. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>231</span>
most familiar of the group is the old Tyrolese <i>Josef Anton Koch</i>, who came
to Rome in 1796, and, during two years, had an opportunity of allying himself
with Carstens. His pictures are usually composed with motives taken from
the Sabine Mountains. A landscape with &ldquo;The Rape of Hylas&rdquo; is possessed
by the Staedel Institute in Frankfort, a &ldquo;Sacrifice of Noah&rdquo; by the Museum
in Leipzig, and a landscape from the Sabine Mountains by the New Pinakothek
in Munich. All three show little promise in technique; it was only in water-colour
that he painted with more freedom.</p>

<p>Without a doubt nature in Italy is favourable to this &ldquo;heroic&rdquo; style of
landscape. In South Italy the country is at once magnificent and peaceful.
The naked walls of rock display their majestic lines with a sharp contour;
the sea is blue, and there is no cloud in the sky. As far as the eye reaches
everything is dead and nugatory in its colour, and rigid and inanimate in
form: a plastic landscape, full of style but apparently devoid of soul. Nowhere
is there anything either stupendous or familiar, though, at the same
time, there is no country on the earth where there is such a sweep of proud
majestic lines. It was not the composition of Poussin, but the classic art
of Claude&mdash;which aimed at being nothing but the transparent mirror of sunny
and transparent nature&mdash;that gave perfect expression to this classic landscape;
and in the nineteenth century <i>Karl Rottmann</i>, according to what one reads,
has most completely represented this same classical form of art. His twenty-eight
Italian landscapes in the arcades of the Munich Hofgarten are said to
display a sense of the beauty of line and a greatness of conception paralleled
by few other landscape works of the century. And those who draw their
critical appreciations from books will probably continue to make this statement,
with all the greater right since the world has been assured that the
Arcade pictures are but a shadow of earlier splendour. To a spectator who
has not been primed and merely judges with his own eyes without knowing
anything about Rottmann&rsquo;s celebrity, these pictures with their hard, inept
colouring and their pompous &ldquo;synthetic&rdquo;
composition seem in the
majority of cases to be excessively
childish, though it is not contested
that before their restoration by
Leopold Rottmann and their present
state of decay they may very possibly
have been good. Rottmann&rsquo;s Grecian
landscapes in the New Pinakothek
are not ranked high even by his
admirers. Standing in the beginning
entirely upon Koch&rsquo;s ground, he was
led in these pictures to give more
importance to colour and light, and
even to introduce unusual phenomena,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>232</span>
such as lowering skies, with rainbows, sunsets, moonlight scenes, thunderstorms,
and the like. This mixture of classical principles of drawing with
effect-painting in the style of Eduard Hildebrandt brought a certain confusion
into his compositions, to say nothing of the fact that he never got rid of his
harsh and heavy colour, Bengal lights, and a crudeness of execution suggestive
of tapestry. His water-colours, probably, contain the only evidence from
which it may be gathered that Rottmann really had an eminent feeling for
great characteristic lines, and did not unsuccessfully go through the school
of Claude with his finely moulded, rhythmically perfected, and yet simple
conception of nature.</p>

<p>Otherwise <i>Friedrich Preller</i> is the only one of all the stylists deriving
from Koch who rose to works consistent in execution. To him only was
it granted to assure his name a lasting importance by exhaustively working
out a felicitous subject. The <i>Odyssey</i> landscapes extend through his whole
life. During a sojourn in Naples in 1830 he was struck by the first idea.
After his return home he composed for Doctor Härtel in Leipzig the first
series as wall decoration in tempera in 1832-34. Then there followed his
journeys to Rügen and Norway, where he painted wild strand and fell
landscapes of a sombre austerity. After this interruption, so profitably
extending his feeling for nature, he returned to the <i>Odyssey</i>. The series
grew from seven to sixteen cartoons, which were to be found in 1858 at
the Munich International Exhibition. The Grand Duke of Weimar then
commissioned him to paint the complete sequence for a hall in the Weimar
Museum. In 1859-60 Preller prepared himself afresh in Italy, and as an
old man completed the work which he
had planned in youth. This Weimar
series, executed in encaustic painting,
is artistically the maturest that he ever
did. Of the entire school he only had
the secret of giving his figures a semblance
of life, and concealed the artificiality
of his compositions. Nature
in his pictures has an austere, impressive
sublimity, and is the worthy home
of gods and heroes. During his long
life he had made so many and such
incessant studies of nature in North and
South&mdash;even at seventy-eight he was
seen daily with his sketch-book in the
Campagna&mdash;that he could venture to
work with great, simple lines without the
danger of becoming empty.</p>

<p>At the time when these pictures were
painted the rendering of still-life in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>233</span>
landscape had in general been long buried, although even to-day it has scattered
representatives in the younger Preller, Albert Hertel, and Edmund Kanoldt.
As antique monuments came into fashion with Classicism, German ruins
became the mode at the beginning of the romantic period and the return
to the national past. For Koch and his followers landscape was only of
value when, as the background of classical works of architecture, it directed
one&rsquo;s thoughts to the antique: shepherds had to sit with their flock around
them on the ruins of the temple of Vesta, or cows to find pasture between the
truncated pillars of the Roman Forum. But now it could only find its
justification by allying itself with mediæval German history, by the portrayal
of castles and strongholds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is beautiful?&mdash;A landscape with upright trees, fair vistas, atmosphere
of azure blue, ornamental fountains, stately palaces in a learned architectural
style, with well-built men and women, and well-fed cows and sheep.
What is ugly?&mdash;Ill-formed trees with aged, crooked, and cloven stems, uneven
and earthless ground, sharp-cut hills and mountains which are too high, rude
or dilapidated buildings, with their ruins lying strewn in heaps, a sky with
heavy clouds, stagnant water, lean cattle in the field, and ungraceful wayfarers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In these words Gérard de Lairesse, the ancestor of Classicism, defined his
ideal of landscape, and in the last clause, where he speaks of ugliness, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>234</span>
prophetically indicated the landscape ideal of the Romanticists, as this is
given for the first time in literature in Tieck&rsquo;s <i>Sternbald</i>. For the young
knight in <i>Sternbald</i> who desires to become a painter exclaims with enthusiasm:
&ldquo;Then would I depict lonely and terrible regions, rotting and broken bridges,
between two rough cliffs facing a precipice, through which the forest stream
forces its foaming course, lost travellers whose garments flutter in the moist
wind, the dreaded figures of robbers ascending from the gully, waggons
fallen upon and plundered, and battle against the travellers.&rdquo; Which
is all exactly the opposite to what Lairesse demanded from the landscapist.
Alexander Humboldt has shown that the men of antiquity only
found beauty in nature so far as she was kindly, smiling, and useful to
them. But to the Romanticists nature was uncomely where she was the
servant of civilisation, and beautiful only in tameless and awe-inspiring
savageness. The light, therefore, was never to be that of simple day, but the
gloom of night and of the mountain glens. Such phenomena are neither to
be seen in Berlin nor in Breslau, and to be a Romanticist was to love the
opposite of all that one sees around one. Tieck, who lived in the cold daylight
of Berlin with its modern North German rationalism, has therefore&mdash;and not
by chance&mdash;first felt the yearning for moonlight landscapes of primæval forest;
<i>Lessing</i>, from Breslau, was the first to give it pictorial expression.</p>

<p>Even in the twenties Koch&rsquo;s classical heroic landscapes, executed with an
ideal sweep of line, were contrasted with castle chapels, ruins, and cloister
courts composed in a similarly arbitrary manner. Landscape was no longer
to make its appeal to the understanding by lines, as in the work of the Classicists,
but to touch the spirit by colour. The various hues of moonlight
seemed specially made to awaken sombre emotions. But as yet the technique
of painting was too inadequately trained to express this preconceived &ldquo;mood&rdquo;
through nature itself. To make his intentions clearer, therefore, the painter
showed the effect of natural scenery on the figures in his pictures, illustrating
the &ldquo;mood&rdquo; of the landscape in the &ldquo;accessories.&rdquo; Lessing&rsquo;s early works
represent in art that self-consciously elegiac and melancholy sentimental
rendering of a mood introduced into literature by <i>Sternbald</i>, in his knights,
squires, noble maidens, and other romantic requisites. The melancholy
lingers upon rocks savagely piled upon each other, tumble-down chapels and
ruined castles, in swamps and sombre woods, in old, decaying trees, half-obliterated
paths, and ghostly gravestones; it veils the sky with a dark grey
cerement. Amid hills and glens with wayside crosses, mills, and charcoal-burners&rsquo;
huts may be seen lonely wanderers, praying pilgrims, priests hurrying
from the cloister to bring the last consolation to the dying, riders who have
lost their way, and mercenary soldiers lying dead. His first picture of 1828
revealed a desolate churchyard beneath a dark and lowering heaven, from
which a solitary sunbeam bursts forth to illumine a grave-stead. Then followed
the castle by the sea standing upon strangely moulded cliffs heaped in confusion;
the churchyard in the snow where the nuns in the cloisters are following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>235</span>
a dead sister to the grave; the churchyard cloister, likewise in snow, where
an old man has dug a fresh grave; the cloister in the light of evening with a
priest visiting the sick; the landscape with the weary, grey-headed crusader,
riding on a weary horse through a lonely mountain district, probably meant
as an illustration to Uhland&rsquo;s ballad <i>Das Rosennest</i>&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">and then came the desolate tableland with the robbers&rsquo; den burnt to ashes,
and the landscape with the oak and the shrine of the Virgin, before which a
knight and noble lady are making their devotions. As yet all these pictures
were an arbitrary <i>potpourri</i> from Walter Scott, Tieck, and Uhland, and their
ideal was the Wolf&rsquo;s Glen in the <i>Freischütz</i>.</p>

<p>The next step which Romanticism had to take was to discover such primæval
woodland scenes in actual nature, and as Italian landscape seems, as it were,
to have been made for Claude, nature, as she is in Germany, makes a peculiar
appeal to this romantic temperament. In certain parts of Saxon Switzerland
the rocks look as if giants of the prime had played ball with them or piled
them one on top of the other in sport. Lessing found in 1832 a landscape
corresponding to the romantic ideal of nature in the Eifel district, whither
he had been induced to go by a book by Nöggerath, <i>Das Gebirge im Rheinland
und Westfalen nach Mineralogischem und Chemischem Bezuge</i>. Up to that
time he had only known the romantic ideal of nature through Scott, Tieck, and
Uhland, just as the Classicists had taken their ideal from Homer, Theocritus,
and Virgil: in the Eifel district it came before him in tangible form. Flat,
swampy tracts of shrub and spruce alternated with dark woods, where gigantic
firs, weird pines, and primæval
oaks raised their branches to the
sky. At the same time he beheld
the rude and lonely sublimity of
nature in union with a humanity
which was as yet uncultivated,
and for that reason all the simpler
and the healthier, judged by the
Romanticist&rsquo;s distaste for civilisation.
Defiant cones of rock and
huge masses of mountain wildly
piled upon each other overlooked
valleys in which a stalwart race
of peasants passed their days in
patriarchal simplicity. Here, for
the first time, a sense for actual
landscape was developed in him;
hitherto it had been alloyed by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>236</span>
taste for knights, robbers, and monks. &ldquo;Oh, had I been born in the seventeenth
century,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;I would have wandered after the Thirty Years&rsquo;
War throughout Germany, plundered, ruined, and run wild as she then was.&rdquo;
Hitherto only &ldquo;composed&rdquo; Italian landscapes had been painted, the soil of
home ostensibly offering no <i>sujets</i>, or, in other words, not suiting those tendencies
which subordinated everything to style: so Lessing was now the first
painter of German landscape. His &ldquo;Eifel Landscape&rdquo; in the Berlin National
Gallery, which was followed by a series of such pictures, introduces the first
period of German landscape painting. The forms of the ground and of the
rough sides of rock are rendered sharply and decisively, from geological knowledge.
On principle he became an opponent of all artistic influence derived
from Italy, and located himself in the Eifel district. The landscapes which
he painted there are founded on immediate studies of nature, and are sustained
by large and earnest insight. He draws the picture of this quarter in strong
and simple lines: the sadness of the heath and the dark mist, the dull breath
of which rises from swampy moorland. Still he painted only scenes in which
nature had taken the trouble to be fantastic. The eye of the painter did not
see her bright side, approaching her only when she looked gloomy or was in
angry humour. Either he veils the sky with vast clouds or plunges into the
darkness of an untrodden forest. Gnarled trees spread around, their branches
stretching out fantastically twisted; the unfettered tumult of the powers of
nature, the dull sultry atmosphere before the burst of the storm or its moaning
subsidence, are the only moments which he represents. But the whole baggage
of unseasonable Romanticism, the nuns and monks, pious knights and sentimental
robbers, at first used to embody the mood of nature, were thrown
overboard. A quieter and more melancholy though thoroughly manly
seriousness, something strong and pithy, lies in the representations of Lessing.
The Romanticists had lost all sense of the dumb silent life of nature. They
only painted the changing adornment of the earth: heroes and the works of
men, palaces, ruins, and classic temples. Nature served merely as a stage
scene: the chief interest lay in the persons, the monuments, and the historical
ideas associated with them. Even in the older pictures of Lessing the mood
was exclusively given by the lyrical accessories. But now it was placed
more and more in nature herself, and rings in power like an organ peal, from
the cloudy sky, the dim lights, and the swaying tree-tops. For the first time
it is really nature that speaks from the canvas, sombre and forceful. In this
respect his landscapes show progress. They show the one-sidedness, but also
the poetry of the Romantic view of nature. And they are no less of an advance
in technique; for in making the discovery that his haunting ideal existed
in reality, Lessing first began to study nature apart from preconceived and
arbitrary rules of composition, and&mdash;learnt to paint.</p>

<p>Up to 1840 there stood at his side a master no less powerful, the refractory,
self-taught <i>Karl Blechen</i>, who only took up painting when he was five-and-twenty,
and became one of the most original of German landscapists, in spite
of a ruined life prematurely closing in mental darkness and suicide. He
possessed a delicate feeling for nature, inspiration, boldness, and a spirited
largeness of manner, although his technique was hard, awkward, and clumsy
to the very end. He might be called the Alfred Rethel of landscape painting.
He was not moved by what was kindly or formally beautiful in nature, but
by loneliness, melancholy, and solitude. Many of his landscapes break away
from peaceful melancholy, and are like the pictures in some horrible nightmare,
ghastly and terrifying; on the other hand, he often surprises us by the
pleasure he takes in homely everyday things, a characteristic hitherto of rare
occurrence. Whereas Lessing never crossed the Alps for fear of losing his
originality, Blechen was the first who saw even modern Italy without the
spectacles of ideal style. From his Italian pictures it would not be supposed
that he had previously studied the landscapes of the Classicists, or that beside
him in Berlin Schinkel worked on the entirely abstract and ideal landscape.
As a painter Blechen has even discovered the modern world. For Lessing
landscape &ldquo;with a purpose&rdquo; was something hideous and insupportable. He
cared exclusively for nature untouched by civilisation, painted the murmuring
wood and the raging storm, here and there at most a shepherd who indicated
the simplest and the oldest employment on the earth&rsquo;s surface. But the
Blechen Exhibition of 1881 contained an entirely singular phenomenon as
regards the thirties, an evening landscape before the iron works in Eberswald:
a long, monotonous plain with a sluggish river, behind which the dark outlines
of vomiting manufactory chimneys rise sullenly into the bright evening sky.
Even in that day Blechen painted what others scarcely ventured to draw:
nature working in the service of man, and thereby&mdash;to use Tieck&rsquo;s expression&mdash;&ldquo;robbed
of her austere dignity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lessing&rsquo;s most celebrated follower, <i>Schirmer</i>, appears in general as a
weakened and sentimental Lessing. He
began in 1828 with &ldquo;A Primæval German
Forest,&rdquo; but a journey to Italy
caused him in 1840 to turn aside from
this more vigorous path. Henceforth his
efforts were directed to nobility of form
and line, to turning out Southern ideal
landscapes with classically romantic
accessories. The twenty-six Biblical
landscapes drawn in charcoal, belonging
to the Düsseldorf Kunsthalle, the four
landscapes in oil with the history of the
Good Samaritan in the Kunsthalle of
Carlsruhe, and the twelve pictures on the
history of Abraham in the Berlin National
Gallery, are the principal results of this
second period&mdash;his period of ideal style.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>240</span>
They are tame efforts at a compromise between Lessing and Preller, and
therefore of no consequence to the history of the development of landscape
painting. Amongst the many who regarded him as a model, <i>Valentin
Ruths</i> of Hamburg is one of the most natural and delicate. His pictures,
however, did not display any new impulse to widen the boundary by proceeding
more in the direction of healthy and honestly straightforward
observation of nature, or by emancipating himself from the school of regular
composition and the rendering of an arbitrary mood.</p>

<p>Meanwhile this impulse came from another quarter. At the very time
when the <i>genre</i> artists were painting their earliest pictures of rustic life
under the influence of Teniers and Ostade, the landscapists also began
to return to the old Dutch masters, following Everdingen in particular.
Thus another strip of nature was conquered, another step made towards
simplicity. The landscape ideal of the Classicists had been architecture,
that of the Romanticists poetry; from this time forward it became pure
painting. Little Denmark, which fifty years before had exercised through
Carstens that fateful influence on Germany which led painters from the
treatment of contemporary life and sent them in pursuit of the antique,
now made recompense for the evil it had done. During the twenties and
thirties it produced certain landscapists who guided the Germans to
look with a fresh and unfettered gaze, undisturbed by the ideal, at
nature in their own country, after the aberrations of Classicism and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>241</span>
one-sidedness of the Romanticists. Under Eckersberg the Academy of
Copenhagen was the centre of a healthy realism founded on the Dutch,
and some of the painters who received their training there and laboured
in later years in Dresden, Düsseldorf, and Munich spread abroad the principles
of this school.</p>

<p><i>J. C. Dahl</i> taught as professor in the Academy of Dresden. At the present
time his Norwegian landscapes seem exceedingly old-fashioned, but in the
thirties they evidently must have been something absolutely new, for they
raised a hue and cry amongst the German painters as &ldquo;the most wild
naturalism.&rdquo; In 1788 Johann Christian Clausen Dahl was born in Bergen.
He was the son of one of those Norwegian giants who are one day tillers of
the soil and on the morrow fishers or herdsmen and hunters, who cross the
sea in their youth as sailors and clear the waste land when they return home.
As he wandered with his father through the dense, solitary pine forests, along
abrupt precipices, sullen lakes, rushing waterfalls, silvery shining glaciers,
the majesty of Northern nature was revealed to him, and he rendered them
in little coloured drawings, which, in spite of their awkward technique, bear
witness to an extraordinary freshness of observation. The course of study
at the Copenhagen Academy, whither he proceeded in his twentieth year,
enabled him to become acquainted with Everdingen and Ruysdael, and these
two old masters, who had also painted Norwegian landscapes, stimulated
him to further efforts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>242</span></p>

<p>Dahl became the first representative of Norwegian landscape painting,
and remained true to his country even when in 1819 he undertook a professorship
in Dresden. Italy and Germany occupied his brush as much as Norway,
but he was only himself when he worked amongst the Norwegian cliffs.
Breadth of painting and softness of atmosphere are wanting in all his pictures.
They are hard and dry in their effect, and not seldom entirely conventional;
especially the large works painted after 1830. In them he gave the impression
of a bewildering, babbling personality. They have been swiftly conceived
and swiftly painted, but without artistic love and fine feeling. In his later
years Dahl did not allow himself the time to bury himself in nature quietly
and with devotion, and finally&mdash;especially in his moonlight pictures&mdash;took
to using a violet-blue, which has a very conventional effect. Everdingen
sought by preference for what was forceful and violently agitated in nature;
Ruysdael felt an enthusiasm for rushing mountain streams. But for Dahl
even these romantic elements of Northern nature were not enough. He
approached nature, not to interpret her simply, but to arrange his effects.
In his picture the wild Norwegian landscape had to be wilder and more restless
than in reality it is. Not patient enough to win all its secrets from the savage
mountain torrent, he forced together his effects, made additions, brought
confusion into his picture as a whole, and a crudeness into the particular
incidents. His large pictures have a loud effect contrasted with the simple
intuition of nature amongst the Netherlanders. Many of them are merely
fantastically irrational compositions of motives which have been learned
by heart.</p>

<p>But there were also years in which Dahl stood in the front rank of his age,
and even showed it the way to new aims. He certainly held that position
from 1820 to 1830 in those pictures in which, instead of making romantic
adaptations of Ruysdael and Everdingen, he resembled them by rendering
the weirdness and eeriness and the rough and wild features of Norwegian
scenery: red-brown heaths and brownish green turf-moors, stunted oaks and
dark pine forests, erratic blocks sown without design amid the roots of trees,
branches snapped by the storm and hanging as they were broken, and trunks
felled by the tempest and lying where they fell. In certain pictures in the
Bergen and Copenhagen Galleries he pointed out the way to new aims. The
tendency to gloom and seriousness which reigns in those Dutch Romanticists
has here yielded to what is simple and familiar, to the homely joy of the people
of the North in the crisp, bright day and the wayward sunbeams. He loves
the glimmer of light upon the birch leaves and the peacefully rippling sea.
Like Adrian van der Neer, he studied with delight the wintry sky, the snow-clad
plains, and the night and the moonshine. He began to feel even the
charm of spring. Poor peasant cots are brightly and pleasantly perched
upon moist, green hills, as though he had quite forgotten what his age demanded
in &ldquo;artistic composition.&rdquo; Or the summer day spreads opulent and real
between the cliffs, and the warm air vibrates over the fields. Peasants and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>243</span>
cattle, glimmering birches and village spires, stand vigorously forth in the
landscape; even the execution is so simple that with all his richness of detail
he succeeds in attaining a great effect. It is felt that this painting has
developed amid a virgin nature, surrounded by the poetry of the fjord, the
lofty cliff, and the torrent. In the same measure the Dutch had not the
feeling for quietude and habitable, humble, and familiar places. And perhaps
it was not by chance that this reformer came from the most virgin country
of Europe, from a country that had had no share in any great artistic epoch
of the past.</p>

<p><i>Caspar David Friedrich</i>, that singular painter who carried on his artistic
work in Greifswald, and later in Dresden also, is, if anything, almost more
original and startling. Like Dahl, he studied under Eckersberg, at the
Academy in Copenhagen, and it was this elder artist who opened his
eyes to nature, in which he saw moods and humours as romantic as they
were modern. His work was not seen in a right light until shown in the
German Centenary Exhibition of 1906, when his just place was first, in the
history of art, assigned to him.</p>

<p>For Munich a similar importance was won by the Hamburg painter <i>Christian
Morgenstern</i>, who, like all artists of this group, imitated the Dutch in the
tone of his colour, though as a draughtsman he remained a fresh and healthy
son of nature. Even what he accomplished in all naïveté between 1826 and
1829, through direct study of Hamburg landscape, is something unique in
the German production of that age. His sketches and etchings of these years
assure him a high place amongst the earliest German &ldquo;mood&rdquo; painters, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>244</span>
show that as a landscapist he had at that time made the furthest advance
towards simplicity and intimacy of feeling. A journey to Norway, undertaken
in 1829, and a sojourn at the Copenhagen Academy, where he worked
up his Norwegian studies, only extended his ability without altering his principles;
and when he came to Munich in the beginning of the thirties his new
and personal intuition of nature made a revolution in artistic circles. The
landscape painters learnt from him that Everdingen, Ruysdael, and Rembrandt
were contemporaries of Poussin, that foliage need not be an exercise of style,
and is able properly to indicate the nature of the tree. He discovered the
beauty of the Bavarian plateau for the Munich school.</p>

<p>Even the first picture that he brought with him from Hamburg displayed
a wide plain shadowed by clouds&mdash;a part of the Lüneberg heath&mdash;and to
this type of subject he remained faithful even in later days. Himself a child
of the plains, he sought for kindred motives in Bavaria, and found them in
rich store on the shore of the Isar, in the quarries near Polling, at Peissenberg,
and in the mossy region near Dachau. His pictures have not the power
of commanding the attention of an indifferent spectator, but when they
have been once looked into they are seen to be poetic, quiet, harmless, sunny,
and thoughtful. He delighted in whatever was ordinary and unobtrusive,
the gentle nature of the wood, the surroundings of the village, everything
homely and familiar. If Rottmann revelled in the forms of Southern nature,
Morgenstern abided by his native Germany; where Lessing only listened to
the rage of the hurricane, Morgenstern hearkened to the quiet whisper of the
breeze. The shadows of the clouds and the radiance of the sun lie over the
dark heath, the moonlight streams dreamily over the quiet streets of the
village, the waves break, at one moment rushing noisily and at another gently
caressing the shore. Later, when he turned to the representation of the
mountains, he lost the intimacy of feeling which was in the beginning peculiar
to him. In mountain pictures, often as he attempted ravines, waterfalls,
and snowy Alpine summits, he never succeeded in doing anything eminently
good. These pictures have something petty and dismembered, and not the
great, simple stroke of his plains and skies.</p>

<p>What Morgenstern was for Munich, <i>Ludwig Gurlitt</i> was for Düsseldorf&mdash;the
most eminent of the great Northern colony which migrated thither in the
thirties. His name is not to be found in manuals, and the pictures of his later
period which represent him in public galleries seldom give a full idea of his
importance. After a journey to Greece in 1859 he took to a brown tone, in
which much is conventional. Moreover, his retired life&mdash;he resided from
1848 to 1852 in a Saxon village, and from 1859 to 1873 in Siebleben, near
Gotha&mdash;contributed much to his being forgotten by the world. But the
history of art which seeks operative forces must do him honour as the first
healthy, realistic landscape painter of Germany, and&mdash;still more&mdash;as one who
opened the eyes of a number of younger painters who have since come to fame.</p>

<p>Gurlitt was a native of Holstein, and, like Morgenstern, received his first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>245</span>
instruction in Hamburg, where at that time Bendixen, Vollmer, the Lehmanns,
and the Genslers formed an original group of artists. After this, as in the
case of Morgenstern also, there followed a longer sojourn in Norway and Copenhagen.
In Düsseldorf, where he then went, a Jutland heath study made
some sensation on his arrival. It was the first landscape seen in Düsseldorf
which had not been composed, and Schadow is said to have come to
Gurlitt&rsquo;s studio, accompanied by his pupils, to behold the marvel. In 1836
he migrated to Munich, where Morgenstern had worked before him, and here
he produced a whole series of works, which reveals an artist exceedingly
independent in sentiment, and one who even preserves his individuality in
the presence of the Dutch. His pictures were grey in tone, and not yellowish,
like those of the Dutch; moreover, they were less composed and less &ldquo;intelligently&rdquo;
dressed out with accessories than the pictures of Dahl; they were
glances into nature resulting from earnest, realistic striving. Even when
he began to paint Italian pictures, as he did after 1843, he preserved a
straightforward simplicity which was not understood by criticism in that
age, though it makes the more sympathetic appeal at the present day. The
strength of his realism lay, as was the case with all artists of those years,
rather in drawing; but at times he reaches, even in painting, a remarkable
clearness and delicacy, which at one time verges on the silver tone of Canaletto,
at another on the fine grey of Constable.</p>

<p>Realism begins in German art with the entry of these Northern painters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>246</span>
into Düsseldorf and Munich.  They were less affected by æsthetic prejudices,
and fresher and healthier than the Germans.  Gurlitt was specially their
intellectual leader, the soul, the driving force of the great movement which
now followed.  Roused by him, <i>Andreas Achenbach</i> emancipated himself
from the landscape of style, and, in the years from 1835 to 1839, painted
Norwegian pictures even before he knew Norway.  Roused by Gurlitt, Achenbach
set forth upon the pilgrimage thither, the journey which was a voyage
of discovery for German landscape painting.</p>

<p>Until Achenbach&rsquo;s death in 1905 he yearly exhibited works which were no
longer in touch with the surrounding efforts of younger men, and there was an
inclination to make little of his importance as a pioneer.  What is wanting
in his pictures is artistic zeal; what he seems to have too much of is routine.
Andreas Achenbach is, as his portrait shows, a man of great acuteness. From
his clear, light blue eyes he looks sharply and sagaciously into the world around;
his short, thick-set figure, proud and firm of carriage, in spite of years, bears
witness to his tough energy.  His forehead, like Menzel&rsquo;s, is rather that of an
architect than of a poet; and his pictures correspond to his outward appearance.
Each one of his earlier good pictures was a battle fought and won.
Realism incarnate, a man from whom all visionary enthusiasm lay at a world-wide
distance, he conquered nature by masculine firmness and unexampled
perseverance.  He appears as a <i>maître-peintre</i>, a man of cool, exact talent
with a clear and sober vision.  The chief characteristic of his organism was his
eminent capacity for appreciating the artistic methods of other artists, and
adapting what was essential in them to his own manner of production.  One
breathes more freely before the works of the masters of Barbizon, and merely
sees good pictures in those of Achenbach.  The former are captivating by
their intimate penetration, where he is striking by his bravura of execution.
His landscapes have no chance inspiration, no geniality.  Everything is harmonised
for the sake of pictorial effect.  The structure and scaffolding are
of monumental stability.  Yet fine as his observation undoubtedly is, he has
never surprised the innermost working of nature, but merely turned her to
account for the production of pictures.  For the French artists colour is the
pure expression of nature and of her inward humour, but for Achenbach it is
just the means for attaining an effectiveness similar to that of the Dutch.
Penetrating everything thoroughly with those sparkling blue eyes of his, he
learnt to render conscientiously and firmly the forms of the earth and its
outward aspect, but the moods of its life appealing to the spirit like music
were never disclosed to him.  The paintings of the Dutch attracted him to art,
not the impulse to give token to his own peculiar temperament.  He thinks
more of producing pictures which may equal those of his forerunners in their
merits than of rendering the impression of nature which he has himself
received.  His intelligence quickens at the study of the rules and theories
set up by the Dutch, and he seeks for spots in nature where he may
exercise these principles, but remains chill at the sight of sky and water, trees
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>247</span>
and mountains. It is not mere love of nature that has guided his brush, but
a refined calculation of pictorial effect; and as he never went beyond this
endeavour after rounded expression, as it was understood by the Dutch,
though he certainly set German landscape free from a romantic subjection
to style like Schirmer&rsquo;s, he never led it to immediate personal observation of
nature. It is not the fragrance of nature that is exhaled from his pictures, but
the odour of oil and varnish; and as the means he made use of to attain his
effects never alter, the result is frequently conventional and methodic.</p>

<p>But this does not alter the fact that, when the development of German
landscape painting is in question, the name of Andreas Achenbach will be
always heard in connection with it. He united technical qualities of the
higher order with the capacity of impressing the public, and therefore he
completed the work that the Danes had begun. He was the reformer who
gave evidence that it was not alone by cliffs and baronial castles and murmuring
oaks that sentiment was to be awakened; he hated everything unhealthy,
mawkish, and vague, and by showing the claws of the lion of realism in the
very heart of the romantic period he came to have the significance of a hero
in German landscape painting. He forced demure Lower German landscape
to surrender to him its charms; he revealed the fascination of Dutch canal
scenes, with their quaint architecture and their characteristic human figures;
he went to the stormy, raging North Sea, and opposed the giant forces of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>248</span>
boisterous, unfettered nature to the tame pictures of the school of Schirmer.
Achenbach&rsquo;s earliest North Sea pictures were exhibited at the very time
when Heine&rsquo;s North Sea series made its appearance, and they soon ousted the
wrecks of the French painter Gudin, which, up to that time, had dominated
the picture market. For the first time in the nineteenth century sea-pieces
were so painted that the water really seemed a fluent, agitated element, the
waves of which did not look as if they had been made of lead, and the froth
and foam of cotton wool. The things which he was specially felicitous in
painting were Rhine-land villages with red-tiled roofs, Dutch canals with
yellow sandbanks and running waves breaking at the wooden buttresses of
the harbour, Norwegian scenes with stubborn cliffs and dark pines, wild
torrents and roaring waterfalls. He did not paint them better than Everdingen
and Ruysdael had done, but he painted them better than any of his
contemporaries had it in their power to do.</p>

<p>As Gurlitt is connected with the present by Achenbach, Morgenstern is
connected with it by <i>Eduard Schleich</i>. The Munich picture rendering a mood
took the place of Rottmann&rsquo;s architectural pictures. Instead of the fair
forms of the earth&rsquo;s surface, artists began to study the play of sunlight on the
plain and amid the flight of the clouds, and instead of the build of the landscape
they turned to notice its atmospheric mood. Through Morgenstern Schleich
was specially directed to Ruysdael and Goyen. In Ruysdael he was captivated
by that profound seriousness and that sombre observation of nature which
corresponded to something in his own humour; in Goyen by the pictorial
harmony of sunlight, air, water, and earth. Schleich has visited France,
Belgium, Hungary, and Italy, yet it is only by exception that he has painted
anything but what the most immediate vicinity of Munich might offer. He
chose the plainest spot in nature&mdash;a newly tilled field, a reedy pond, a stretch
of brown moorland, a pair of cottages and trees; and under the guidance of
Goyen he observed the changes of the sky with great care&mdash;the retreat of
thunderclouds, the sun shrouded by thin veils of haze, the tremulous moonlight,
or the hovering of the morning and evening mists. The Isar district
and the mossy Dachauer soil were his favourite places of sojourn. He had
a special preference for rain and moonlight and the mood of autumn, in rendering
which he toned brown and grey hues to fine Dutch harmonies. His keynote
was predominantly serious and elegiac, but he also loved scenes in which
there was a restless and violent change of light. Over a wide plateau the
sunlight spreads its radiance, whilst from the side an army of dense thunderclouds
approaches, threatening storm and casting dark shadows. Over a
monotonous plain, broken by solitary clumps of trees, the warm summer rain
falls dripping down. Trees and shrubs throw light shadows, and the plain
glistens in the beams of the sun. Or else there is a wide expanse of moor.
Darkling the clouds advance, the rushes bend before the wind, and narrow
strips of moonlight glitter amid the slender reeds. By such works Schleich
became the head of the Munich school of landscape without having ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>249</span>
directed the study of pupils. Through him and through Achenbach capacity
for the fresh observation of the life of nature was given to German painters.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly amongst the younger group of artists there was a great
difference in regard to choice of subject. The modern rendering of mood
has only had its origin in Germany; it could not finally develop itself there.
Just as figure painting, after making so vigorous a beginning with Bürkel,
turned to <i>genre</i> painting in the hands of Enhuber and Knaus, until it returned
to its old course in Leibl, landscape also went through the apprentice period
of interesting subject, until it once more recognised the poetry of simpleness.
The course of civilisation itself led it into these lines. When Morgenstern
painted his first pictures the post-chaise still rattled from village to village,
but now the whistle of the railway engine screams shrill as the first signal of
a new age throughout Europe. Up to that time the possibility of travelling
had been greatly circumscribed by the difficulties of traffic. But facilitated
arrangements of traffic brought with them such a desire for travel as had
never been before. In literature the revolution displayed itself by the rise of
books of travels as a new branch of fiction. Hackländer sent many volumes
of touring sketches into the market. Theodor Mügge made Norway, Sweden,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>250</span>
and Denmark the scene of his tales. But America was the land where the
Sesame was to be found, for Germany had been set upon the war-trail with
Cooper&rsquo;s Indians, it had Charles Sealsfield to describe the grotesque mountain
land of Mexico, the magic of the prairie, and the landscapes of Susquehannah
and the Mississippi, and read Gerstäcker&rsquo;s, Balduin Möllhausen&rsquo;s, and Otto
Ruppius&rsquo; transatlantic sketches with unwearying excitement. The painters
who found their greatest delight in seeing the world with the eyes of a tourist
also became cosmopolitan.</p>

<p>In Geneva <i>Alexander Calame</i> brought Germany to the knowledge of what
is to be seen in Switzerland. Calame was, indeed, a dry, unpoetic landscapist.
He began as a young tradesman by making little coloured views of Switzerland
which foreigners were glad to bring away with them as mementoes of their
visits, just as they now do photographs. Even his later pictures can only
lay claim to the merit of such &ldquo;mementoes of Switzerland.&rdquo; His colour is
insipid and monotonous, his atmosphere heavy, his technique laborious. By
painting he understood the illumination of drawings, and his drawing was
that of an engraver. An excellent drawing-master, he possessed an unusual
mastery of perspective. On the other hand, all warmth and inward life are
wanting in his works. Sentiment has been replaced by correct manipulation,
and in the deep blue mirror of his Alpine lakes, as in the luminous red of his
Alpine summits, there is always to be seen the illuminator who has first drawn
the contours with a neat pencil and pedantic correctness. His pictures are
grandiose scenes of nature felt in a petty way&mdash;in science too it is often the
smallest spirit that seeks the greatest heroes. &ldquo;The Ruins of Pæstum,&rdquo;
like &ldquo;The Thunderstorm on the Handeck&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Range of Monte-Rosa
at Sunrise,&rdquo; merely attain an external, scenical effect which is not improved
by crude and unnatural contrasts of light. And as, in later years, when
orders accumulated, he fell a victim to an astounding fertility, many of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>251</span>
works give one the impression
of a dexterous calligrapher
incessantly repeating
the same ornamental letters.
&ldquo;<i>Un Calame, deux Calame,
trois Calame&mdash;que de calamités</i>,&rdquo;
ran the phrase every
year in the Paris Salon.</p>

<p>But if France remained
cool he found the more
numerous admirers in Germany.
When, in 1835, he
exhibited his first pictures
in Berlin, a view of the
Lake of Geneva, his appearance
was at once hailed with
the warmest sympathy. The
dexterity, the rounded form,
the finish of his pictures,
were exactly what gave
pleasure, and the distinctness
of his drawing made its
impression. His lithograph
studies of trees and his landscape
copies attained the importance
of canonical value,
and for whole decades remained
in use as a medium of instruction in drawing. Amongst German
painters <i>Carl Ludwig</i>, <i>Otto von Kameke</i>, and <i>Count Stanislaus Kalkreuth</i>
were specially incited by Calame to turn to the sublimity of Alpine nature.
Desolate wastes of cliffs, still, clear blue lakes, wild, plunging torrents, and
mountain summits covered with glaciers and glowing to rose colour in the
reflection of the setting sun are the elements of their pictures as of those of
the Genevan master.</p>

<p>After Achenbach there came a whole series of artists from the North who
began to depict the mountains of their native Norway under the strong colour
effects of the Northern sun. The majestic formations of the fjords, the emerald
green walls of rock, the cloven valleys, the terrible forest wildernesses, and the
mountains of Norway dazzlingly illuminated and reflecting themselves like
glittering jewels in the quiet waters of sapphire blue lakes, were interesting
enough to afford nourishment for more than one landscapist.</p>

<p><i>Knud Baade</i>, who worked from 1842 in Munich, after a lengthy sojourn
at the Copenhagen Academy and with Dahl in Dresden, delighted in moonlight
scenes, gloomy fir forests, and midnight suns. The sea rises in waves mountain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>252</span>
high, and tosses mighty vessels like withered leaves or dashes foaming against
the cliffs of the shore. Fantastic clouds chase each other across the sky,
and the wan moonlight rocks unsteadily upon the waves. More seldom he
paints the sea lit up afar by the moon, or the fjord with its meadows and
silver birches; and in such plain pictures he makes a far more attractive effect
than in those which are wild and ambitious, for his diffident, petty execution
is, as a rule, but little suited to restless and, as it were, dramatic scenes of
nature.</p>

<p>Having come to Düsseldorf in 1841, <i>Hans Gude</i> became the Calame of the
North. Achenbach taught him to approach the phenomena of nature boldly
and realistically, and not to be afraid of a rich and soft scale of colour.
Schirmer, the representative of Italian still landscape, guided him to the acquisition
of a certain large harmony and sense for style in the structure of his
pictures, to beauty of line and effective disposition of great masses of light and
shade. This quiet, sure-footed, and robust realism, which had, at the same time,
a gift of style, became the chief characteristic of his Northern landscapes, in
which, however, the mutable and fleeting moods of nature were all the more
neglected. Here are Norwegian mountain landscapes with lakes, rivers, and
waterfalls, then pictures of the shore under the most varied phases of light,
or grand cliff scenery with a sombre sky and a sea in commotion. Hans Gude,
living from 1864 in Carlsruhe, and from 1880 in Berlin, is one of those painters
whom one esteems, but for whom it is not possible to feel great enthusiasm&mdash;one
of those conscientious workers who from their very solidity run the
risk of becoming tedious. His landscapes are good gallery pictures, soberly
and prosaically correct, and never irritating, though at the same time they
seldom kindle any warm feeling.</p>

<p>Like Gude, <i>Niels Björnson Möller</i> devoted himself to pictures of the shore
and the sea. Undisturbed by men in his sequestered retreat, <i>August Capellen</i>
gave way to the melancholy charms of the Norwegian forest. He represented
the tremulous clarity of the air above the cliffs, old, shattered tree-trunks
and green water plants, sleepy ponds, and far prospects bounded by blue
mountains; but he would have made an effect of greater originality had he
thought less of Schirmer&rsquo;s noble line and compositions arranged in the grand
style. <i>Morten-Müller</i> became the specialist of the fir forest. His native
woods where the valleys stretch towards the high mountain region offered
him motives, which he worked up in large and excessively scenical pictures.
His strong point was the contrast between sunlight playing on the mountain
tops and mysterious darkness reigning in the forest depths, and his pictures
have many admirers on account of &ldquo;their elegiac melancholy, their minor
key of touching sadness.&rdquo; The Norwegian spring changing the earth into one
carpet of moorland, broken by marshes, found its delineator in <i>Erik Bodom</i>.
<i>Ludwig Munthe</i> became the painter of wintry landscape in thaw, when the
snow is riddled with holes and a dirty brown crust of earth peeps from the
dazzling mantle. A desolate field, a pair of crippled trees stretching their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>253</span>
naked branches to the dark-grey sky, a swarm of crows and a drenched road
marked with the tracks of wheels, a tawny yellow patch of light gleaming
through the cloud-bank and reflected in the wayside puddles, such are the
elements out of which one of Munthe&rsquo;s landscapes is composed. Through
<i>Eilert Adelsten Normann</i> representations of the fjords gained currency in the
picture market. His specialty was the delineation of the steep and beetling
rocky fastnesses of Lofodden with their various reflections of light and colour,
the midnight sun glaring over the deep clear sea, the contrast between the
blue-black masses of the mountains and the gleaming fields of snow.</p>

<p>Others, such as <i>Ludwig Willroider</i>, <i>Louis Douzette</i>, and <i>Hermann Eschke</i>,
set themselves to observe the German heath and the German forest from
similar points of view; the one painted great masses of mountain and giant
trees, the other the setting sun, and the third the sea. <i>Oswald Achenbach</i>,
<i>Albert Flamm</i>, and <i>Ascan Lutteroth</i> set out once more on the pilgrimage to the
South, where, in contrast to their predecessors, they studied no longer the
classic lines of nature in Italy, but the splendour of varied effects of colour in
the neighbourhood of Vesuvius and the Bay of Naples. The most enterprising
turned their backs on Europe altogether, and began to paint the primæval
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>254</span>
forests of South America, to which Alexander Humboldt had drawn attention,
the azure and scarlet wonders of the tropics, and the gleam and sparkle of the
icy world at the ultimate limits of the Polar regions. <i>Ferdinand Bellermann</i>
was honoured as a new Columbus when in 1842 he returned home with his
sketches, botanically accurate as they were, of the marvels of the virgin forest.
<i>Eduard Hildebrandt</i>, who in 1843 had already gone through the Canary Islands,
Italy, Sicily, North Africa, Egypt, Nubia, Sahara, and the Northern sea of
ice, at the mandate of Frederich Wilhelm IV in 1862 undertook a voyage round
the world &ldquo;to learn from personal view the phenomena that the sea, the air,
and the solid earth bring forth beneath the most various skies.&rdquo; <i>Eugen
Bracht</i> traversed Egypt, Syria, and Palestine, and returned with a multitude
of studies from the sombre and majestic landscape of the desert, and from
that world of ruins and mountains in the East, and developed them at home
into as many pictures.</p>

<p>A modicum of praise is due to all these masters for having continually
widened the circuit of subject-matter, and gradually disclosed the whole
world; and if their works cannot be reckoned as the products of a delicate
landscape painting, that is a result of the same taste which prescribed anecdotic
and narrative subjects to the <i>genre</i> picture of those years. The landscape
painters conquered the earth, but, above all, those parts of it which were
geographically remarkable. This they did in the interest of the public. They
went with a Baedeker in their pocket into every quarter of the globe, brought
with them all the carmine necessary for sunsets, and set up their easels at
every place marked with an asterisk in the guidebook. And in these fair
regions they noted everything that was to be seen with the said Baedeker&rsquo;s
assistance. Through satisfying the interest of the tourist by a rendering,
faithful to a hair&rsquo;s breadth, of topographically instructive points, they could
best reckon on the sale of their productions.</p>

<p>At the same time, their pictures betray that, during this generation,
historical painting was throned on a summit whence it could dictate the
æsthetic catechism. The historical picture represented a humanity that
carried about with it the consciousness of its outward presence, draped itself
in front of the glass, and made an artificial study of every gesture and every
expression of emotion. <i>Genre</i> painting followed, and rendered the true spirit
of life, illustrating it histrionically, but without surprising it in its unconstrained
working. And so trees, mountains, and clouds also were forced to
lay aside the innocence of unconscious being and wrap themselves in the cloak
of affectation. Simple reality in its quiet, delicate beauty, the homely &ldquo;mood&rdquo;
of nature, touching the forms of landscape with the play of light and air, had
nothing to tell an age overstrained by the heroics of history and the grimaces
of <i>genre</i> painting. A more powerful stimulus was necessary. So the landscapists
also were forced to seek nature where she was histrionic and came forth
in blustering magnificence; they were forced to send off brilliant pyrotechnics
to fire out sun, moon, and stars in order to be heard, or, more literally, seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>255</span></p>

<p>Instruction or theatrical effect&mdash;the aim of historical painting&mdash;had also
to be that of the landscape painter. And as railroads are cosmopolitan
arrangements, he was in a position to satisfy both demands with promptitude.
As historical painters in the chase of striking subjects directed their gaze to
the farthest historical horizon, and the <i>genre</i> painters sought to take their
public captive principally through what was alien and strange, Oriental and
Italian, the landscape painters, too, found their highest aim in the widest
possible expansion of the geographical horizon. &ldquo;Have these good people not
been born anywhere in particular?&rdquo; asked Courbet, when he contemplated
the German landscapes in the Munich Exhibition of 1869. What would
first strike the inhabitant of a Northern country in foreign lands was made
the theme of the majority of the pictures. But as the historical painting, in
illustrating all the great dramatic scenes from the Trojan War to the French
Revolution, yielded at one time to a pædagogical doctrinaire tendency and
at another to theatrical impassionedness, so landscape painting on its cosmopolitan
excursions became partly a dry synopsis of famous regions, only
justifiable as a memento of travel, partly a tricked-out piece of effect which,
like everything obtrusive, soon lost its charm. Pictures of the first description
which chiefly borrowed their motives from Alpine nature, so imposing in
its impressiveness of form&mdash;grand masses of rock, glaciers, snow-fields, and
abrupt precipices&mdash;only needed to have the fidelity of a portrait. Where that
was given, the public, guided by the instinct for what is majestic and beautiful
in nature, stood before them quite content, while Alpine travellers instructed
the laity that the deep blue snow of the picture was no exaggeration, but a
phenomenon of the mountain world which had been correctly reproduced.
In all these cases there can be no possible doubt about geographical position,
but there is seldom any need to make inquiries after the artist. The interest
which they excite is purely of a topographical order; otherwise they bear the
stamp of ordinary prose, of the aridity and unattractiveness which always
creeps in as a consequence of pure objectivity. Works of the second description,
which depict exotic regions, striking by the strangeness of various
phenomena of light and the splendour and glow of colour, are generally
irritating by their professional effort to display &ldquo;mood.&rdquo; The old masters
revealed &ldquo;mood&rdquo; without intending to do so, because they approached nature
piously and with a wealth of feeling. The new masters obtain a purely
external effect, because they strain after a &ldquo;mood&rdquo; in their painting without
feeling it; and though art does not exclude the choice of exotic subjects, it
is not healthy when a tendency of this sort becomes universal. Really superior
art will, from principle, never seek the charm of what is strange and distant,
since it possesses the magical gift of bestowing the deepest interest on what
lies nearest to it. In addition to this, such effects are as hard to seize as the
moment of most intense excitement in the historical picture. As an historical
painter Delacroix could render it, and Turner as a landscape painter, but
geniuses like Delacroix and Turner are not born every day. As these phenomena
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>256</span>
were painted at the time in Germany, the right &ldquo;mood&rdquo; was not excited
by them, but merely a frigid curiosity. Almost all landscapes of these years
create an effect merely through their subject; they are entertaining, astonishing,
instructive, but the poetry of nature has not yet been aroused. It could
only reveal itself when the preponderance of interest in mere subject was no
longer allowed. As the figure painters at last disdained through narrative
and &ldquo;points&rdquo; to win the applause of those who had no sensitiveness for art,
so the landscape painters were obliged to cease from giving geographical
instruction by the representation of nature as beloved by tourists, and to give
up forcing a &ldquo;mood&rdquo; in their pictures by a subterfuge. The necessary degree
of artistic absorption could only go hand in hand with a revolt against purely
objective interest of motive, and with a strenuous effort at the representation
of familiar nature in the intimate charm of its moods of light and atmosphere.
It was necessary for refinement of taste to follow on the expression of subject-matter;
and this impulse had to bring artists back to the path struck by
Dahl, Morgenstern, and Gurlitt. To unite the simple, moving, and tender
observation of those older artists with richer and more complex methods of
expression was the task given to the next generation in France, where <i>paysage
intime</i>, the most refined and delicate issue of the century, grew to maturity in
the very years when German landscape painting roamed through the world
with the joy of an explorer.</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER XXIV</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE BEGINNINGS OF &ldquo;PAYSAGE INTIME&rdquo;</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">How</span> it was that the secrets of <i>paysage intime</i> were reserved for our own
century&mdash;and this assuredly by no mere accident&mdash;can only be delineated
in true colours when some one writes a special history of landscape
painting, a book which at the present time would be the most seasonable in
the literature of art. Wereschagin once declared that in the province of
landscape the works of the old masters seem like the exercises of pupils in
comparison with the performances of modern art; and certain it is that the
nineteenth century, if it is inferior to previous ages in everything else, may,
at any rate, offer them an equivalent in landscape. It was only city life that
could produce this passionately heightened love of nature. It was only in
the century of close rooms and over-population, neurosis and holiday colonies,
that landscape painting could attain to this fulness, purity, and sanctity. It
was only our age of hurry and work that made possible a relation between
nature and the human soul, which really has something of what the Earth
Spirit vouchsafed to Faust: &ldquo;to gaze into her heart as into the bosom of a
friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In France also, the tendency which since the eighteenth century had made
itself felt in waves rising ever higher, had been for a short time abruptly
interrupted by Classicism. Of the pre-revolutionary landscapists <i>Hubert
Robert</i> was the only one who survived into the new era. His details of nature
and his <i>rococo</i> savour were pardoned to him for the sake of his classic ruins.
At first there was not one of the newer artists who was impelled to enter this
province. A generation which had become ascetic, and which dreamed only
of rude, manly virtue, expressed through the plastic and purified forms of the
human body, had lost all sense for the charms of landscape. And when the
first landscapes appeared once more, after several years, they were, as in
Germany, solemn stage-tragedy scenes, abstract &ldquo;lofty&rdquo; regions such as
Poussin ostensibly painted. Only in Poussin a great feeling for nature held
together the conventional composition, in spite of all his straining after style;
whereas nothing but frigid rhetoric and sterile formalism reigns in the works
of these newer painters, works which were created at second-hand. The type
of the beautiful which had been borrowed from the antique was worked into
garden and forest with a laboured effort at style, as it had been worked into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>258</span>
the human form and the flow of drapery. A <i>prix de Rome</i> was founded for
historical landscapes.</p>

<p><i>Henri Valenciennes</i> was the Lenôtre of this Classicism, the admired teacher
of several generations. The beginner in landscape painting modelled himself
upon Valenciennes as the figure painter upon Guérin. His <i>Traité élémentaire
de perspective pratique</i>, in which he formulated the principles of landscape,
contains his personal views as well as the æsthetics of the age. Although,
as he premises, he &ldquo;is convinced that there is in reality only one kind of
painting, historical painting, it is true that an able historical painter ought
not entirely to neglect landscape.&rdquo; Rembrandt, of course, and the old Dutch
painters were without any sort of ideal, and only worked for people without
soul or intelligence. How far does a landscape with cows and sheep stand
below one with the funeral of Phocion, or a rainy day by Ruysdael below
a picture of the Deluge by Poussin! Hardly does Claude Lorrain find grace
in the eyes of Valenciennes. &ldquo;He has painted with a pretty fidelity to nature
the morning and evening light. But just for that very reason his pictures
make no appeal to the intelligence. He has no tree where a Dryad could
dwell, no spring in which nymphs could splash. Gods, demigods, nymphs,
satyrs, even heroes are too sublime for these regions; shepherds could dwell
there at best.&rdquo; Claude, indeed, loved Italy, but knew the old writers all too
little, and they are the groundwork for landscape painters. As David said
to his pupil Gros, &ldquo;Look through your Plutarch,&rdquo; Valenciennes advised his
own pupils to study Theocritus, Virgil, and Ovid: only from these authors
might be learnt what were the regions suitable for gods and heroes.</p>

</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>If, for example, the landscapist would paint Morning, let him portray the
moment when Aurora rises laughing from the arms of her aged spouse, when
the hours are yoking four fiery steeds to the car of the sun-god, or Ulysses
kneels imploring before Nausicaa. For Noon the myth of Icarus or of Phaëton
might be turned to account. Evening may be represented by painting Ph&oelig;bus
hastening his course as he nears the horizon in flaming desire to cast himself
into the arms of Thetis. Having once got his themes from the old poets,
the landscape painter must know the laws of perspective to execute his picture;
he must be familiar with Poussin&rsquo;s rules of composition, and occasionally
he ought even to study nature. Then he needs a weeping willow for an elegy,
a rock for the death of Phaëton, and an oak for the dance of the nymphs.
To find such motives he should make journeys to the famed old lands of
civilisation; best of all on the road which art itself has traversed&mdash;first to
Asia Minor, then to Greece, and then to Italy.</p>

<p>These æsthetics produced <i>Victor Bertin</i> and <i>Xavier Bidault</i>, admired by
their contemporaries for &ldquo;richness of composition and a splendid selection
of sites.&rdquo; Their methodical commonplaces, their waves and valleys and
temples, bear the same relation to nature as the talking machine of Raimundus
Lullus does to philosophy. The scholastic landscape painter triumphed; a
school it was which nourished itself on empty formulas, and so died of anæmia.
Bidault, who in his youth made very good studies, is, with his stippled leaves
and polished stems, his grey skies looking sometimes like lead and sometimes
like water, the peculiar essence of a tiresome Classicism; and he is the same
Bidault who, as president of the hanging committee, for years rejected the
landscapes of Théodore Rousseau from the Salon. It is only the figure of
<i>Michallon</i>, who died young, that still survives from this group. He too
belongs to the school of Valenciennes, through his frigid, meagre, and pedantically
correct style; but he is distinguished from the rest, for he endeavoured
to acquire a certain truth to nature in the drawing of plants, and was accounted
a bold innovator at the time. He did not paint &ldquo;the plant in itself,&rdquo; but
burs, thistles, dandelions, everything after its kind, and through this botanical
exactness he acquired in the beginning of the century a fame which it is now
hard to understand. In the persons of <i>Jules Cogniet</i> and <i>Watelet</i> the gates
of the school were rather more widely opened to admit reality. Having long
populated their classic valleys with bloodless, dancing nymphs and figurants
of divine race, they abandoned historical for picturesque landscape, and
&ldquo;dared&rdquo; to represent scenes from the environs of Paris, castles and windmills.
But as they clung even here to the classical principles of composition,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>260</span>
it is only nature brushed and combed, trimmed and coerced by rules, that is
reflected in their painting. Even in 1822, when Delacroix exhibited his
&ldquo;Dante&rsquo;s Bark,&rdquo; the ineffable Watelet shone in his full splendour. Amongst
his pictures there was a view of Bar-sur-Seine, which the catalogue appropriately
designated not simply as a <i>vue</i>, but as a <i>vue ajustée</i>. Till his last
breath Watelet was convinced that nature did not understand her own business,
and was always in need of a painter to revise her errors and correct them.</p>

<p>Beside this group who adapted French localities for classical landscapes
there arose in the meantime another group, and they proceeded in the opposite
direction. Their highest aim was to go on pilgrimage to sacred Italy, the
classic land, which, with their literary training and their one-sided æsthetics,
they invariably thought more beautiful and more worthy of veneration than
any other. But they tried to break with Valenciennes&rsquo; arbitrary rules of
composition, and to seize the great lines of Italian landscape with fidelity
to fact. In going back from Valenciennes to Claude they endeavoured to
pour new life into a style of landscape painting which was its own justification,
compromised as it had been by the Classic school. They made a very heretical
appearance in the eyes of the strictly orthodox pupils of Valenciennes. They
were called the Gothic school, which was as much as to say Romanticists,
and the names of <i>Théodore Aligny</i> and <i>Edouard Bertin</i> were for years mentioned
with that of Corot in critiques. They brought home very pretty drawings
from Greece, Italy, Egypt, Palestine, and Syria, and Bertin did this especially.
Aligny is even not without importance as a painter. He aimed at width of
horizon and simplicity of line more zealously than the traditional school had
done. He is, indeed, a man of sombre, austere, and earnest talent, and the
solemn rhythm of his pictures would have more effect if the colour were not
so dry, and if a fixed and monotonous light were not uniformly shed over
everything in place of a vibrating atmosphere.</p>

<p><i>Alexandre Desgoffe</i>, <i>Paul Flandrin</i>, <i>Benouville</i>, <i>Bellel</i>, and others drew
from the same sources with similar conviction and varying talent. Paul
Flandrin, in particular, was in his youth a good painter in the manner of 1690.
His composition is noble and his execution certain, recalling Poussin. Ingres,
his master, said of him, &ldquo;If I were not Ingres I would be Flandrin.&rdquo; It was
only later that the singular charm of Claude Lorrain and the Roman majesty
of Poussin were transformed under the brush of Flandrin into arid still-life,
into landscapes of pasteboard and wadding.</p>

<p>But not from this quarter could the health of a school which had become
anæmic be in any way restored. French landscape had to draw a new power
of vitality from the French soil itself. It was saved when its eyes were opened
to the charms of home, and this revelation was brought about by Romanticism.
In the Salon notices, from 1822 onwards, the complaints of critics are repeated
with increasing violence&mdash;complaints that, instead of fair regions, noble
character, and monumental lines, nothing but &ldquo;malarious lakes, desolate
wastes, and terrible cliffs&rdquo; should be painted, which, in the language of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>261</span>
Classicism, means that French landscape painting had taken firm hold of
the soil in France. The day when Racine was declared by the young Romanticists
to be a maker of fine phrases put an end to the whole school of David
and to Classical landscape at the same time. It fell into oblivion, as, sooner
or later, every artistic movement which does not rest on the nature and personality
of the artist inevitably must. The young revolutionaries no longer
believed that an alliance with mythological subjects and &ldquo;grand composition&rdquo;
could compensate for the lack of air and light. They were tired of pompous,
empty, and distant scenery. They only thought of nature, and that amid
which they lived seemed the less to forego its charms the more Italy came
under suspicion as the home of all these ugly, unpleasant, and academical
pictures. That was the birthday of French landscape. At the very time
when Delacroix renewed the <i>répertoire</i> of grand painting, enriching art with
a world of feeling which was
not merely edited, a parallel
movement began in landscape.
&ldquo;Dante&rsquo;s Bark&rdquo; was
painted in 1822, &ldquo;The Massacre
of Chios&rdquo; in 1824.
Almost at the same hour a
tornado swept through the
branches of the old French
oaks, and bent the rustling
corn; the sky was covered
with clouds, and the waters,
which had been hard-bound
for so long, sped purling once
more along their wonted
course. The little paper
temples, built on classic
heights, toppled down, and
there rose lowly rustic cottages,
from the chimneys of
which the smoke mounted
wavering to the sky. Nature
awoke from her wintry sleep,
and the spring of modern
landscape painting broke
with its sadness and its
smiles.</p>

<p>This is where the development
of French art diverges
from that of German. After
it had stood under the influence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>262</span>
of Poussin, the German long continued to have a suspicious preference
for scenery that was devoid of soul, for beautiful views, as the phrase
is, and it penetrated much later into the spirit of familiar nature. But
as early as the twenties this spirit had revealed itself to the French. It
was only in the province of poetry that they went through the period of
enthusiasm for exotic nature&mdash;and even there not to the same extent as
Germany. Only in Chateaubriand&rsquo;s <i>Atala</i> are there to be found pompously
pictorial descriptions of strange landscapes which have been in no degree
inwardly felt. Chiefly it was the virgin forests of North America that afforded
material for splendid pictures, which he describes in grandiloquent and soaring
prose. A nature which is impressive and splendid serves as the scenery of
these dramas of human life. But with Lamartine the reaction was accomplished.
He is the first amongst the poets of France who conceived landscape
with an inward emotion, and brought it into harmony with his moods of soul.
His poetry was made fervent and glorified by love for his home, for his own
province, for South Burgundy. Even in the region of art a poet was the first
initiator.</p>

<p><i>Victor Hugo</i>, the father of Romanticism in literature, cannot be passed
over in the history of landscape painting. Since 1891, when that remarkable
exhibition of painter-poets was opened in Paris&mdash;an exhibition in which
Théophile Gautier, Prosper Merimée, the two de Goncourts, and others were
represented by more or less important works&mdash;the world learnt what a gifted
draughtsman, what a powerful dramatist in landscape, was this great
Romanticist. Even in the reminiscences of nature&mdash;spirited and suggestive
of colour as they are&mdash;which he drew with a rapid hand in the margin of his
manuscripts, the fiery glow of Romanticism breaks out. The things of which
he speaks in the text appear in black shadows and ghostly light. Old castles
stand surrounded by clouds of smoke or the blinding glare of fire, moonrise
makes phantom silhouettes of the trees, waves lashed by the storm dash together
as they spout over vessels; and there are gloomy seas and dark unearthly
shores, fairy palaces, proud citadels, and cathedrals of fabled story. Whenever
one of his finished drawings is bequeathed to the Louvre, Hugo is certain to
receive a place in the history of art as one of the champions of Romanticism.</p>

<p>The movement was so universal amongst the painters that it is difficult
at the present time to perceive the special part that each individual played in
the great drama. This is especially true of <i>Georges Michel</i>, a genius long
misunderstood, a painter first made known in wider circles by the World
Exhibition in 1889, and known to the narrower circle of art lovers only since
his death in 1843. At that time a dealer had bought at an auction the works
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>264</span>
left behind by a half-famished painter&mdash;pictures with no signature, and only
to be identified because they collectively treated motives from the surroundings
of Paris. A large, wide horizon, a hill, a windmill, a cloudy sky were his
subjects, and all pointed to an artist schooled by the Dutch. Curiosity was
on the alert, inquiry was made, and it was found that the painter was named
Georges Michel, and had been born in 1763; that at twelve years of age he
had shirked school to go drawing, had run away with a laundress at fifteen,
was already the father of five children when he was twenty, had married
again at sixty-five, and had worked hard to his eightieth year. Old men
remembered that they had seen early works of his in the Salon. It was said
that Michel had produced a great deal immediately after the Revolution, but
exceedingly tedious pictures, which differed in no respect from those of the
other Classicists; for instance, from Demarne and Swebach, garnished with
figures. It was only after 1814 that he disappeared from the Salon; not,
as has been now discovered, because he had no more pictures to exhibit, but
because he was rejected as a revolutionary. During his later years Michel
had been most variously employed: for one thing, he had been a restorer
of pictures.</p>

<p>In this calling many Dutch pictures had passed through his hands, and
they suggested to him the unseasonable idea of looking more closely into nature
in the neighbourhood than he had done in his youth&mdash;nature not as she was
in Italy, but in the environs of the city. While Valenciennes and his pupils
made so many objections to painting what lay under their eyes, Georges
Michel remained in the country, and was the first to light on the idea of placing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>265</span>
himself in the midst of nature, and not above her; no longer to arrange and
adapt, but to approach her by painting her with directness. If any one spoke
of travelling to Italy, he answered: &ldquo;The man who cannot find enough to
paint during his whole life in a circuit of four miles is in reality no artist. Did
the Dutch ever run from one place to another? And yet they are good
painters, and not merely that, but the most powerful, bold, and ideal artists.&rdquo;
Every day he made a study in the precincts of Paris, without any idea that
he would count in these times among the forerunners of modern art. He
shares the glory of having discovered Montmartre with Alphonse Karr, Gérard
de Nerval, and Monselet. After his death such studies were found in the
shops of all the second-hand dealers of the Northern Boulevard; they were
invariably without a frame, as they had never seemed worth framing, and
when they were very dear they were to be had for forty francs. Connoisseurs
appreciated his wide horizons, stormy skies, and ably sketched sea-shores.
For, in spite of his poverty, Michel had now and then deserted Montmartre
and found means to visit Normandy. Painfully precise in the beginning,
while he worked with Swebach and Demarne, he had gradually become large
and bold, and employed all means in giving expression to what he felt. He
was a dreamer, who brought into his studies a unison of lights, and, now and
then, beams of sun which would have delighted Albert Cuyp. A genuine
offspring of the old Dutch masters&mdash;of the grand and broad masters, not of
those who worked with a fine brush&mdash;already he was aiming at <i>l&rsquo;expression
par l&rsquo;ensemble</i>, and since the
Paris Universal Exhibition he has
been fittingly honoured as the forerunner
of Théodore Rousseau. His
pictures, as it seems, were early received
in various studios, and there
they had considerable effect in setting
artists thinking. But as he ceased
to date his pictures after 1814 it
is, nevertheless, difficult to be more
precise in determining the private
influence which this Ruysdael of
Montmartre exerted on men of the
younger generation.</p>

<p>One after the other they began
to declare the Italian pilgrimage to
be unnecessary. They buried themselves
as hermits in the villages
around the capital. The undulating
strip of country, rich in wood and
water, which borders on the heights
of Saint-Cloud and Ville d&rsquo;Avray, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>266</span>
the cradle of French landscape painting. In grasping nature they proceeded
by the most various ways, whilst they drew everything scrupulously and exactly
which an observing eye may discern, or wedded their own temperament
with the moods of nature.</p>

<p>That remarkable artist <i>Charles de la Berge</i> seems like a forerunner of the
English Pre-Raphaelite school. He declared the ideal of art to consist in
painting everything according to nature, and overlooking nothing; in carrying
drawing to the most minute point, and yet preserving the impression of unison
and harmony in the picture&mdash;which is as easy to say as it is difficult to
perform. His brief life was passed in this struggle. His pictures are miracles
of patience: to see that it is only necessary to know the &ldquo;Sunset&rdquo; of 1839,
in the Louvre. There is something touching in the way this passionate worker
had branches and the bark of trees brought to his room, even when he lay on
his deathbed, to study the contortions of wood and the interweaving of fibres
with all the zeal of a naturalist. The efforts of de la Berge have something of
the religious devotion with which Jan van Eyck or Altdorfer gazed at nature.
But he died too young to effect any result. He copied the smallest particulars
of objects with the utmost care, and in the reproduction even of the smallest
aimed at a mathematical precision, neutralising his qualities of colour, which
were otherwise of serious value, by such hair-splitting detail.</p>

<p><i>Camille Roqueplan</i>, the many-sided pupil of Gros, made his first appearance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>267</span>
as a landscape painter with a sunset in 1822. He opposed the genuine windmills
of the old Dutch masters to those everlasting windmills of Watelet, with
their leaden water and their meagre landscape. In his pictures a green plain,
intersected by canals, stretches round; a fresh and luminous grey sky arches
above. That undaunted traveller <i>Camille Flers</i>, who had been an actor and
ballet dancer in Brazil before his appearance as a painter, represented the rich
pastures of Normandy with truth, but was diffident in the presence of nature
where she is grand. His pupil, <i>Louis Cabat</i>, was hailed with special enthusiasm
by the young generation on account of his firm harmonious style. His pictures
showed that he had been a zealous student of the great Dutch artists, and that
it was his pride to handle his brush in their manner, expressing as much as
possible without injuring pictorial effect. He is on many sides in touch with
Charles de la Berge. Later he even had the courage to see Italy with fresh
eyes, and in a simple manner to record his impressions without regard for the
rules and theories of the Classicists. But the risk was too great. He became
once more an admirer of imposing landscape, an adherent of Poussin, and as
such he is almost exclusively known to us of a younger generation.</p>

<p><i>Paul Huet</i> was altogether a Romanticist. In de la Berge there is the
greatest objectivity possible, in Huet there is impassioned expression. His
heart told him that the hour was come for giving passion utterance; he wanted
to render the energy of nature, the intensity of her life, with the whole might
of vivid colouring. In his pictures there is something of Byronic poetry;
the conception is rich and powerful,
the symphony of colour passionately
dramatic. In every one of his landscapes
there breathes the human soul
with its unrest, its hopelessness, and
its doubts. Huet was the child of an
epoch, which at one moment exulted
to the skies and at another sorrowed
to death in the most violent contrast;
and he has proclaimed this temper of
the age with all the freedom and
power possible, where it is only
earth and sky, clouds and trees that
are the medium of expression. Most
of his works, like Romanticism in
general, have an earnest, passionate,
and sombre character; nothing of
the ceremonial pompousness peculiar
to Classical landscapes. He has a
passion for boisterous storms and
waters foaming over, clouds with the
lightning flashing through them, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>268</span>
the struggle of humanity against the raging elements. In this effort to
express as much as possible he often makes his pictures too theatrical in
effect. In one of his principal works, the &ldquo;View of Rouen,&rdquo; painted in 1833,
the breadth of execution almost verges on emptiness and panoramic view.
Huet was in the habit of heaping many objects together in his landscapes.
He delighted in expressive landscapes in the sense in which, at that time,
people delighted in expressive heads. This one-sidedness hindered his success.
When he appeared in the twenties his pictures were thought bizarre and
melancholy. And later, when he achieved greater simplicity, he was treated
by the critics merely with the respect that was paid to the Old Guard, for now
a pleiad of much brighter stars beamed in the sky.</p>

<p>But we must not forget that Michel and Huet showed the way. Rousseau
and his followers left them far behind, as Columbus threw into oblivion all
who had discovered America before him, or Gutenberg all who had previously
printed books. The step on which these initiators had stood was more or
less that of Andreas Achenbach and Blechen. They are good and able painters,
but they still kept the Flemish and Dutch masters too much in their memory.
It is easy to detect in them reminiscences of Ruysdael and Hobbema and the
studies of gallery pictures grown dim with age. They still coloured objects
brown, and made spring as mournful as winter, and morning as gloomy as
evening; they had yet no sense that morning means the awakening of life,
the youth of the sun, the springtide of the day. They still composed their
pictures and finished and rounded them off for pictorial effect. The next
necessary step was no longer to look at Ruysdael and Cuyp, but at nature&mdash;to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>269</span>
lay more emphasis on sincerity of impression, and therefore the less upon
pictorial finish and rounded expression&mdash;to paint nature, not in the style of
galleries, but in its freshness and bloom. And the impulse to this last step,
which brought French landscape painting to its highest perfection, was given
by England.</p>

<p>The most highly gifted work produced in this province between the years
1800 and 1830 is of English origin. At the time when landscape painting was
in France and Germany confined in a strait-waistcoat by Classicism, the
English went quietly forward in the path trodden by Gainsborough in the
eighteenth century. In these years England produced an artist who stands
apart from all others as a peculiar and inimitable phenomenon in the history
of landscape painting, and at the same time it produced a school of landscape
which not only fertilised France, but founded generally the modern conception
of colour.</p>

<p>That phenomenon is <i>Joseph Mallord William Turner</i>, the great pyrotechnist,
one of the most individual and intellectual landscape painters of all time. What
a singular personality! And how vexatious he is to all who merely care
about correctness in art! Such persons divide the life of Turner into two
halves, one in which he was reasonable and one in which he was a fool. They
grant him a certain talent during the first fifteen years of his activity, but
from the moment when he is complete master of his instrument, from the
moment when the painter begins in glowing enthusiasm to embody his personal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>270</span>
ideal, they would banish him from the kingdom of art, and lock him up in
a madhouse. When in the forties the Munich Pinakothek was offered a picture
by Turner, glowing with colour, people, accustomed to the contours of Cornelius,
knew no better than to laugh at it superciliously. It is said that in his last
days he sent a landscape to an exhibition. The committee, unable to discover
which was the top or which the bottom, hung it upside-down. Later, when
Turner came into the exhibition and the mistake was about to be rectified,
he said: &ldquo;No, let it alone; it really looks better as it is.&rdquo; One frequently
reads that Turner suffered from a sort of colour-blindness, and as late as 1872
Liebreich wrote an article printed in <i>Macmillan</i>, which gave a medical explanation
of the alleged morbid affection of the great landscape painter&rsquo;s eyes.
Only thus could the German account for his pictures, which are impressionist,
although they were painted about the middle of the century. The golden
dreams of Turner were held to be eccentricities of vision, since no one was
capable of following this painter of momentary impressions in his majesty of
sentiment, and the impressiveness and poetry of his method of expression.</p>

<p>In reality Turner was the same from the beginning. He circled round the
fire like a moth, and craved, like Goethe, for more light; he wanted to achieve
the impossible and paint the sun. To attain his object nothing was too difficult
for him. He restrained himself for a long time; placed himself amongst the
followers of the painter of light <i>par excellence</i>; studied, analysed, and copied
Claude Lorrain; completely adopted his style, and painted pictures which
threw Claude into eclipse by their magnificence and luminous power of colour.
The painting of &ldquo;Dido building Carthage&rdquo; is perhaps the most characteristic
of this phase of his art. One feels that the masses of architecture are merely
there for the sake of the painter; the tree in the foreground has only been
planted in this particular way so that the background may recede into farther
distance. The colour is splendid, though still heavy. By the union of the
principles of classic drawing with an entirely modern feeling for atmosphere
something chaotic and confused is frequently introduced into the compositions
of these years. But at the hour when it was said to him, &ldquo;You are the real
Claude Lorrain,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;Now I am going to leave school and begin to
be Turner.&rdquo; Henceforth he no longer needs Claude&rsquo;s framework of trees to
throw the light beaming into the corners of his pictures. At first he busied
himself with the atmospheric phenomena of the land of mist. Then when the
everlasting grey became too splenetic for him he repaired to the relaxing,
luxuriant sensuousness of Southern seas, and sought the full embodiment of
his dreams of light in the land of the sun. It is impossible in words to give
a representation of the essence of Turner; even copies merely excite false
conceptions. &ldquo;Rockets shot up, shocks of cannon thundered, balls of light
mounted, crackers meandered through the air and burst, wheels hissed, each
one separately, then in pairs, then altogether, and even more turbulently one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>272</span>
after the other and together.&rdquo; Thus has Goethe described a display of fireworks
in <i>The Elective Affinities</i>, and this passage perhaps conveys most readily the
impression of Turner&rsquo;s pictures. To collect into a small space the greatest
possible quantity of light, he makes the perspective wide and deep and the sky
boundless, and uses the sea to reflect the brilliancy. He wanted to be able to
render the liquid, shining depths of the sky without employing the earth as an
object of comparison, and these studies which have merely the sky as their
object are perhaps his most astonishing works. Everywhere, to the border
of the picture, there is light. And he has painted all the gradations of light,
from the silvery morning twilight to the golden splendour of the evening red.
Volcanoes hiss and explode and vomit forth streams of lava, which set the
trembling air aglow, and blind the eyes with flaring colours. The glowing
ball of the sun rises behind the mist, and transforms the whole ether into fine
golden vapour; and vessels sail through the luminous haze. In reality one
cannot venture on more than a swift glance into blinding masses of light, but
the impression remained in the painter&rsquo;s memory. He painted what he saw,
and knew how to make his effect convincing. And at the same time his composition
became ever freer and easier, the work of his brush ever more fragrant
and unfettered, the colouring and total sentiment of the picture ever more
imaginative and like those of a fairy-tale. His world is a land of sun, where
the reality of things vanishes, and the light shed between the eye and the
objects of vision is the only thing that lives. At one time he took to painting
human energy struggling with the phenomena of nature, as in &ldquo;Storm at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>273</span>
Sea,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fire at Sea,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rain, Steam, and Speed&rdquo;; at another he painted
poetic revels of colour born altogether from the imagination, like the &ldquo;Sun of
Venice.&rdquo; He is the greatest creator in colour, the boldest poet amongst the
landscape painters of all time! In him England&rsquo;s painting has put forth its
greatest might, just as in Byron and Shelley, those two great powers, the
English imagination unrolled its standard of war most proudly and brilliantly.
There is only one Turner, and Ruskin is his prophet.</p>

<p>As a man, too, he was one of those original characters seldom met with
nowadays. He was not the fastidious <i>gourmet</i> that might have been expected
from his pictures, but an awkward, prosaic, citizen-like being. He had a
sturdy, thick-set figure, with broad shoulders and tough muscles, and was
more like a captain in the merchant service than a disciple of Apollo. He
was sparing to the point of miserliness, unformed by any kind of culture,
ignorant even of the laws of orthography, silent and inaccessible. Like most
of the great landscape painters of the century, he was city-bred. In a gloomy
house standing back in a foggy little alley of Old London, in the immediate
vicinity of dingy, monotonous lodging-houses, he was born, the son of a barber,
on 23rd April 1775. His career
was that of a model youth.
At fifteen he exhibited in the
Royal Academy; when he was
eighteen, engravings were already
being made after his drawings.
At twenty he was known, and
at twenty-seven he became a
member of the Academy. His
first earnings he gained by the
neat and exact preparation of
little views of English castles
and country places&mdash;drawings
which, at the time, took the
place of photographs, and for
which he received half a crown
apiece and his supper. Thus
he went over a great part of
England, and upon one of his
excursions he is said to have
had a love-affair <i>à la</i> Lucy of
Lammermoor, and to have so
taken it to heart that he resolved
to remain a bachelor for
the rest of his life. In 1808 he
became Professor of Perspective
at the Academy, and delivered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>274</span>
himself, it is said, of the most confused utterances on his subjects. His
father had now to give up the barber&rsquo;s business and come to live with
him, and he employed him in sawing, planing, and nailing together boards,
which were painted yellow and used as frames for his pictures. The same
miserly economy kept him from ever having a comfortable studio. He
lived in a miserable lodging where he received nobody, had his meals at
a restaurant of the most primitive order, carried his dinner wrapped up
in paper when he went on excursions, and was exceedingly thankful if
any one added to it a glass of wine. His diligence was fabulous. Every
morning he rose on the stroke of six, locked his door, and worked with
the same dreadful regularity day after day. His end was as unpoetic as his
life. After being several times a father without ever having had a wife, he
passed his last years with an old housekeeper, who kept him strictly under the
yoke. If he was away from the house for long together he pretended that he
was travelling to Venice for the sake of his work, until at last the honest
housekeeper learnt, from a letter which he had put in his overcoat pocket and
forgotten, that the object of all these journeys was not Venice at all, but
Chelsea. There she found him in an attic which he had taken for another
mistress, and where he was living under the name of Booth. In this little
garret, almost more miserable than the room in the back street where he was
born, the painter of light ended his days; and, to connect an atom of poetry
with so sad a death, Ruskin adds that the window looked towards the sunset,
and the dying eyes of the painter received the last rays of the sun which he
had so often celebrated in glowing hymns. He left countless works behind
him at his death, several thousands of pounds, and an immortal fame. This
thought of glory after death occupied him from his youth. Only thus is it
possible to understand why he led the
life of a poor student until his end,
why he did things which bordered
on trickery in the sale of his <i>Liber
Studiorum</i>, and kept for himself all
those works by which he could have
made a fortune. He left them&mdash;taken
altogether, three hundred and
sixty-two oil-paintings and nineteen
thousand drawings&mdash;to the nation,
and £20,000 to the Royal Academy,
and merely stipulated that the two
best pictures should be hung in the
National Gallery between two Claude
Lorrains. Another thousand pounds
was set aside for the erection of a
monument in St. Paul&rsquo;s. There, in
that temple of fame, he lies buried
near Sir Joshua Reynolds, the great ancestor of English painting, and he
remains a phenomenon without forerunners and without descendants.</p>

<p>For it does not need to be said that Turner, with his marked individuality,
could have no influence on the further development of English painting. The
dramatic fervour of Romanticism was here expressed just as little as Classicism.
It was only the poets who fled into the wilderness of nature, and sang the
splendour and the mysteries of the mountains, the lightning and the storm,
the might of the elements. In painting there is no counterpart to Scott&rsquo;s
descriptions of the Highlands or Wordsworth&rsquo;s rhapsodies upon the English
lakes, or to the tendency of landscape painting which was represented in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>276</span>
Germany by Lessing and Blechen. Wordsworth is majestic and sublime, and
English painting lovely and full of intimate emotion. It knows neither ancient
Alpine castles nor the sunsets of Greece. Turner, as a solitary exception,
represented nature stately, terrible, stormy, glorious, mighty, grand, and
sublime; all the others, like Gainsborough, loved simplicity, modest grace, and
virginal quietude. England has nothing romantic. At the very time when
Lessing painted his landscapes, Ludwig Tieck experienced a bitter disappointment
when he trod the soil where Shakespeare wrote the witch scenes in
<i>Macbeth</i>. A sombre, melancholy, primæval maze was what he had expected,
and there lay before him a soft, luxuriant, and cultivated country. What
distinguishes English landscape is a singular luxuriance, an almost unctuous
wealth of vegetation. Drive through the country on a bright day on the top
of a coach, and look around you; in all directions as far as the eye can reach
an endless green carpet is spread over gentle valleys and undulating hills;
cereals, vegetables, clover, hops, and glorious meadows with high rich grasses
stretch forth; here and there stand a group of mighty oaks flinging their
shadows wide, and around are pastures hemmed in by hedges, where splendid
cattle lie chewing the cud. The moist atmosphere surrounds the trees and
plants like a shining vapour. There is nothing more charming in the world,
and nothing more delicate than these tones of colour; one might stand for
hours looking at the clouds of satin, the fine ærial bloom, and the soft transparent
gauze which catches the sunbeams in its silver net, softens them, and
sends them smiling and toying to the earth. On both sides of the carriage
the fields extend, each more beautiful than the last, in constant succession,
interwoven with broad patches of buttercups, daisies, and meadowsweet.
A strange magic, a loveliness so exquisite that it is well-nigh painful, escapes
from this inexhaustible vegetation. The drops sparkle on the leaves like
pearls, the arched tree-tops murmur in the gentle breeze. Luxuriantly they
thrive in these airy glades, where they are ever rejuvenated and bedewed by
the moist air of the sea. And the sky seems to have been made to enliven the
colours of the land. At the tiniest sunbeam the earth smiles with a delicious
charm, and the bells of flowers unfold in rich, liquid colour. The English look
at nature as she is in their country, with the tender love of the man nurtured in
cities, and yet with the cool observation of the man of business. The merchant,
enveloped the whole day long in the smoke of the city, breathes the more
freely of an evening when the steam-engine brings him out into green places.
With a sharp practical glance he judges the waving grain, and speculates on
the chances of harvest. And this spirit of attentive, familiar observation of
nature, which is in no sense romantic, reigns also in the works of the English
landscape painters. They did not think of becoming cosmopolitan like their
German comrades, and of presenting remarkable points, the more exotic the
better, for the instruction of the public. Like Gainsborough, they relied upon
the intimate charm of places which they knew and loved. And as a centre
Norwich first took the place of Suffolk, which Gainsborough had glorified.</p>

<p><i>John Crome</i>, known as Old Crome, the founder of the powerful Norwich
school of landscape, is a healthy and forcible master. Born poor, in a provincial
town a hundred miles from London, in 1769, and at first an errand boy to a
doctor, whose medicines he delivered to the patients, and then an apprentice
to a sign-painter, he lived completely cut off from contemporary England.
Norwich was his native town and his life-long home. He did not know the
name of Turner, nor anything of Wilson, and perhaps never heard the name
of Gainsborough. Thus his pictures are neither influenced by the contemporary
nor by the preceding English art. Whatever he became he owed to himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>278</span>
and to the Dutch. Early married, and blessed with a numerous family, he
tried to gain his bread by drawing-lessons, given in the great country-houses in
the neighbourhood, and in this way had the opportunity of seeing many Dutch
pictures. In later life he came to know Paris at a time when all the treasures
of the world were collected in the Louvre, and this enthusiasm for the Dutch
found fresh nourishment. Even on his deathbed he spoke of Hobbema.
&ldquo;Hobbema,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my dear Hobbema, how I have loved you!&rdquo;
Hobbema is his ancestor, the art of Holland his model.</p>

<p>His pictures were collectively &ldquo;exact&rdquo; views of places which he loved, and
neither composed landscapes nor paintings of &ldquo;beautiful regions.&rdquo; Crome
painted frankly everything which Norfolk, his own county, had to offer him&mdash;weather-beaten
oaks, old woods, fishers&rsquo; huts, lonely pools, wastes of heath.
The way he painted trees is extraordinary. Each has its own physiognomy,
and looks like a living thing, like some gloomy Northern personality. Oaks
were his peculiar specialty, and in later years they only found a similarly
great interpreter in Théodore Rousseau. At the same time his pictures of the
simplest scenes have a remarkable largeness of conception, and a subtlety of
colour recalling the old masters, and reached by no other painter in that age.
An uncompromising realist, he drew his portraits of nature with almost
pedantic pains, but preserved
their relation of
colour throughout. And
as a delicate adept in
colouring he finally harmonised
everything in
the manner of the Dutch
to a juicy brown tone,
which gives his beautiful
wood and field pictures
a discreet and refined
beauty, a beauty in
keeping with the art of
galleries.</p>

<p>Crome took a long
time before he made a
way for himself. His
whole life long he sold
his work merely at
moderate prices: for
no picture did he ever
receive more than fifty
pounds. Even his end
was uneventful. He had
begun as a manual worker,
and he died in 1821 as a humble townsman whose only place of recreation
was the tavern, and who passed his leisure in the society of sailors,
shopkeepers, and artisans. Yet the principles of his art survived him.
In 1805 he had founded in Norwich, far from all Academies, a society of
artists, who gave annual exhibitions and had a common studio, which
each used at fixed hours. <i>Cotman</i>, whose specialty was ash-trees, <i>the
younger Crome</i>, <i>Stark</i>, and <i>Vincent</i>, are the leading representatives of the
vigorous school of Norwich; and by them the name of this town became
as well known as an art-centre in Europe as Delft and Haarlem had been in
former times.</p>

<p>Their relation to the Dutch was similar to that of Georges Michel in France,
or that of Achenbach in Germany. They painted what they saw, rounded it
with a view to pictorial effect, and harmonised the whole in a delicate brown
tone. They felt more attracted by the form of objects than by their colour;
the latter was, in the manner of the Dutch, merely an epidermis delicately
toned down. The next step of the English painters was that they became
the first to get the better of this Dutch phase, and to found that peculiarly
modern landscape painting which no longer sets out from the absolutely
concrete reality of objects, but from the <i>milieu</i>, from the atmospheric effect;
which values in a picture less what is ready-made and perfectly rounded in
drawing than the freshly seized impression of nature.</p>

<p>Hardly twenty years have gone by since &ldquo;open-air painting&rdquo; was introduced
into Germany. At present, things are no longer painted as they are in
themselves but as they appear in their atmospheric environment. Artists
care no longer for landscapes which float in a neutral brown sauce; they represent
objects flooded with light and air. People no longer wish for brown
trees and meadows, for the eye has perceived that trees and meadows are green.
The world is no longer satisfied with the indeterminate light of the studio and
the conventional tone of the picture gallery; it requires some indication of
the hour of the day, since it is felt that the light of morning is different from
the light of noon. And it is the English who made these discoveries, which
have lent to modern landscape painting its most delicate and fragrant charm.</p>

<p>The very mist of England, the damp and the heaviness of the atmosphere,
necessarily forced English landscape painters, earlier than those of other
nations, to the observation of the play of light and air. In a country where
the sky is without cloud, in a pure, dry, and sparkling air, nothing is seen
except lines. Shadow is wanting, and without shadow light has no value.
For that reason the old classical masters of Italy were merely draughtsmen;
they knew how to prize the value of sunshine no more than a millionaire the
value of a penny. But the English understood the charm even of the most
scanty ray of light which forces its way like a wedge through a wall of clouds.
The entire appearance of nature, in their country, where a damp mist spreads
its pearly grey veil over the horizon even upon calm and beautiful summer
days, guided them to see the vehicle of some mood of landscape in the subtlest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>282</span>
elements of light and air. The technique of water-colour painting which, at
that very time, received such a powerful impetus, encouraged them to give
expression to what they saw freshly and simply even in their oil-paintings, and
to do so without regard for the scale of colour employed by the old masters.</p>

<p><i>John Robert Cozens</i>, &ldquo;the greatest genius who ever painted a landscape,&rdquo;
had been the first to occupy himself with water-colour painting as understood
in the modern sense. <i>Tom Girtin</i> had experimented with new methods.
<i>Henry Edridge</i> and <i>Samuel Prout</i> had come forward with their picturesque
ruins, <i>Copley Fielding</i> and <i>Samuel Owen</i> with sea-pieces, <i>Luke Clennel</i> and
<i>Thomas Heaphy</i> with graceful portrayals of country life, <i>Howitt</i> and <i>Robert
Hills</i> with their animal pictures. From 1805 there existed a Society of
Painters in Water-Colours, and this extensive pursuit of water-colour painting
could not fail to have an influence upon oil-painting also. The technique of
water-colour accustomed English taste to that brightness of tone which at first
seemed so bizarre to the Germans, habituated as they were to the prevalence
of brown. Instead of dark, brownish-green tones, the water-colour painters
produced bright tones. Direct study of nature, and the completion of a
picture in the presence of nature and in the open air, guided their attention
to light and atmosphere more quickly than that of the oil-painters. An
easier technique, giving more scope for improvisation, of itself suggested the
idea that rounded finish with a view to pictorial effect was not the final aim
of art, but that it was of the most immediate importance to catch the first
freshness of impression, that flower so hard to pluck and so prone to wither.</p>

<p>The first who applied these principles to oil-painting was <i>John Constable</i>,
one of the greatest pioneers in his own province and one of the most powerful
individualities of the century.</p>

<p>East Bergholt, the pretty little village where Constable&rsquo;s cradle stood, is
fourteen miles distant from Sudbury, the birthplace of Gainsborough. Here
he was born on 11th June 1776, at the very time when Gainsborough settled
in London. His father was a miller, a well-to-do man, who had three windmills
in Bergholt. The other famous miller&rsquo;s son in the history of art is Rembrandt.
At first a superior career was chosen for him; it was intended that he should
become a clergyman. But he felt more at home in the mill than in the schoolroom,
and became a miller like his fathers before him. Observation of the
changes of the sky is an essential part of a miller&rsquo;s calling, and this occupation
of his youth seems to have been not without influence on the future artist;
no one before him had observed the sky with the same attention.</p>

<p>A certain Dunthorne, an eccentric personage to whom the boy often came,
gave him&mdash;always in the open air&mdash;his first instruction; and another of his
patrons, Sir George Beaumont, as an æsthetically trained connoisseur, criticised
what he painted. When Constable showed him a study he asked: &ldquo;Where
do you mean to place your brown tree?&rdquo; For the first law in his æsthetics
was this: a good painting must have the colour of a good fiddle; it
must be brown. Sojourn in London was without influence on Constable. He
was twenty-three years of age, a handsome young fellow with dark eyes and a
fine expressive countenance, when, in 1799, he wrote to his teacher Dunthorne:
&ldquo;I am this morning admitted a student at the Royal Academy; the figure
which I drew for admittance was the Torso. I am now comfortably settled
in Cecil Street, Strand, No. 23.&rdquo; He was known to the London girls as &ldquo;the
handsome young miller of Bergholt.&rdquo; He undertook the most varied things,
copied pictures of Reynolds, and painted an altar-piece, &ldquo;Christ blessing
Little Children,&rdquo; which was admired by no one except his mother. In addition
he studied Ruysdael, whose works made a great impression on him, in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>284</span>
National Gallery. In 1802 he appears for the first time in the Catalogue of
the Royal Academy as the exhibitor of a landscape, and from this time to the
year of his death, 1837, he was annually represented there, contributing
altogether one hundred and four pictures. In the earliest&mdash;windmills and
village parties&mdash;every detail is carefully executed; every branch is painted on
the trees, and every tile on the houses; but as yet one can breathe no air in
these pictures and see no sunshine.</p>

<p>But he writes, in 1803, a very important letter to his old friend Dunthorne.
&ldquo;For the last two years,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I have been running after pictures, and
seeking the truth at second-hand. I have not endeavoured to represent
nature with the same elevation of mind with which I set out, but have rather
tried to make my performance look like the work of other men. I am come
to a determination to make no idle visits this summer, nor to give up my time
to commonplace people. I shall return to Bergholt, where I shall endeavour to
get a pure and unaffected manner of representing the scenes that may employ
me. There is little or nothing in the exhibition worth looking up to. <i>There
is room enough for a natural painter.</i>&rdquo; He left London accordingly, and worked,
in 1804, the whole summer &ldquo;quite alone among the oaks and solitudes of
Helmingham Park. I have taken quiet possession of the parsonage, finding it
empty. A woman comes from the farmhouse, where I eat, and makes my bed,
and I am left at liberty to wander where I please during the day.&rdquo; And having
now returned to the country he became himself again. &ldquo;Painting,&rdquo; he writes,
&ldquo;is with me but another word for feeling; and I associate &lsquo;my careless
boyhood&rsquo; with all that lies upon the banks of the Stour; those scenes made
me a painter, and I am grateful.&rdquo; He had passed his whole youth amid the
lovely valleys and luxuriant meadows of Bergholt, where the flocks were at
pasture and the beetles hummed; he had wandered about the soft banks of the
Stour, in the green woods of Suffolk, amongst old country-houses and churches,
farms and picturesque cottages. This landscape which he had loved as a boy
he also painted. He was the painter of cultivated English landscape, the
portrayer of country life, of canals and boats, of windmills and manor-houses.
He had a liking for all simple nature which reveals everywhere the traces of
human activity&mdash;for arable fields and villages, orchards and cornfields. A
strip of meadow, a watergate with a few briars, a clump of branching, fibrous
trees, were enough to fill him with ideas and feelings. Gainsborough had
already painted the like; but Constable denotes an advance beyond Gainsborough
as beyond Crome. Intimate in feeling as Gainsborough undoubtedly
was, he had a tendency to beautify the objects of nature; he selected and
gave them a delicacy of arrangement and a grace of line which in reality they
did not possess. Constable was the first to renounce every species of adaptation
and arbitrary arrangement in composition. His boldness in the rendering of
personal impressions raises him above Crome. Crome gets his effect principally
by his accuracy: he represented what he saw; Constable showed how he saw
the thing. While the former, following Hobbema, has an air reminiscent of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>285</span>
galleries and old masters, Constable saw the world with his own eyes, and was
the first entirely independent modern landscape painter. In his young days
he had made copies after Claude, Rubens, Reynolds, Ruysdael, Teniers, and
Wilson, which might have been mistaken for the originals, but later he had
learnt much from Girtin&rsquo;s water-colour paintings. From that time he felt that
he was strong enough to trust his own eyes. He threw to the winds all that
had hitherto been considered as the chief element of beauty, and gave up the
rounding of his pictures for pictorial effect; cut trees right through the middle
to get into his picture just what interested him, and no more.</p>

<p>He set himself right in the midst of verdure; the nightingales sang, the
leaves murmured, the meadows grew green, and the clouds gleamed. In the
fifteenth-century art there were the graceful spring trees of Perugino; in the
seventeenth, the bright spring days of those two Flemings Jan Silberecht and
Lucas Uden; in the nineteenth, Constable became the first painter of spring.
If Sir George Beaumont now asked him where he meant to put his brown tree,
he answered: &ldquo;Nowhere, because I don&rsquo;t paint brown trees any more.&rdquo; He
saw that foliage is green in summer, and&mdash;painted it so; he saw that summer
rain and morning dew makes the verdure more than usually intense, and&mdash;he
painted what he saw. He noticed that green leaves sparkle, gleam, and glitter
in the sun&mdash;and painted them accordingly; he saw that the light, when it falls
upon bright-looking walls, dazzles like snow in the sunshine&mdash;and painted it
accordingly. There was a good deal of jeering at the time about &ldquo;Constable&rsquo;s
snow,&rdquo; and yet it was not merely all succeeding English artists who continued
to put their faith in this painting of light, but the masters of Barbizon too,
and Manet afterwards.</p>

<p>The problem of painting light and air, which the older school had left
unsolved, was taken up by him first in its complete extent. Crome had shown
great reserve in approaching the atmospheric elements. Constable was the first
landscape painter who really saw effects of light and air and learnt to paint
them. His endeavour was to embody the impression of a mood of light with
feeling, without lingering on the reproduction of those details which are only
perceptible to an analytical eye. Whereas in the old Dutch masters the chief
weight is laid on the effect of the drawing of objects, here it rests upon light,
no matter upon what it plays. Thus Constable freed landscape painting from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>287</span>
the architectonic laws of composition. They were no longer needed when the
principle was once affirmed that the atmospheric mood gave greater value to
the picture than subject. He not only studied the earth and foliage in their
various tones, according as they were determined by the atmosphere, but
observed the sky, the air, and the forms of cloud with the conscientiousness of
a student of natural philosophy. The comments which he wrote upon them
are as subtle as those in Ruskin&rsquo;s celebrated treatise on the clouds. A landscape,
according to him, is only beautiful in proportion as light and shadow
make it so; in other words, he was the first to understand that the &ldquo;mood&rdquo;
of a landscape, by which it appeals to the human spirit, depends less on its
lines and on objects in themselves than on the light and shadow in which it is
bathed, and he was the first painter who had the secret of painting these
subtle gradations of atmosphere. In his pictures the wind is heard murmuring
in the trees, the breeze is felt as it blows over the corn, the sunlight is seen
glancing on the leaves and playing on the clear mirror of the waters. Thus
Constable for the first time painted nature in all its freshness. His principle
of artistic creation is entirely opposed to that which was followed by the
Pre-Raphaelites at a later date. Whilst the latter tried to reconstruct a picture
of nature by a faithful, painstaking execution of all details&mdash;a process by
which the expression of the whole usually suffers&mdash;Constable&rsquo;s pictures are
broadly and impressively painted, often of rude and brutal force, at times
solemn, at times elegant, but always cogent, fresh, and possessing a unity of
their own.</p>

<p>A genius in advance of its age is only first recognised in its full significance
when following generations have come abreast with it. And that Constable
was made to feel. In 1837 he died in poverty at Hampstead, in the modest
&ldquo;country retreat&rdquo; where he spent the greatest part of his life. He said that
his painting recalled no one, and was neither polished nor pretty, and asked:

<p>Constable&rsquo;s powerful individuality has brought forth enduring fruit, and
helped English landscape painting to attain that noble prime which it enjoyed
during the forties and fifties.</p>

<p>With his rich, brilliant, bold, and finely coloured painting, <i>David Cox</i>
stands out as perhaps the greatest of Constable&rsquo;s successors. Like Constable,
he was a peasant, and observed nature with the simplicity of one who was
country-bred. He was born in 1783, the son of a blacksmith, in a humble
spot near Birmingham, and, after a brief sojourn in London, migrated with
his family to Hereford, and later to Harborne, also in the neighbourhood of
Birmingham. The strip of country which he saw from his house was almost
exclusively his field of study. He knew that a painter can pass his life in the
same corner of the earth, and that the scene of nature spread before him will
never be exhausted. &ldquo;Farewell, pictures, farewell,&rdquo; he is reported to have
said when he took his last walk, on the day before his death, round the walls
of Harborne. He has treated of the manner in which he understood his
art in his <i>Treatise on Landscape Painting</i>, written in 1814. His ideal was
to see the most cogent effect in nature, and leave everything out which
did not harmonise with its character; and in Cox&rsquo;s pictures it is possible
to trace the steps by which he drew nearer to this ideal the more natural
he became. The magic of his brush was never more captivating than in
the works of his last years, when, fallen victim to a disease of the eye,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>289</span>
he could no longer see distinctly and only rendered an impression of the
whole scene.</p>

<p>Cox is a great and bold master. The townsman when he first comes into
the country, after being imprisoned for months together in a wilderness of
brick and mortar, does not begin at once to count the trees, leaves, and the
stones lying on the ground. He draws a long breath and exclaims, &ldquo;What
balm!&rdquo; Cox, too, has not painted details in the manner of the Pre-Raphaelites.
He represented the soft wind sweeping over the English meadows,
the fresh purity of the air, the storms that agitate the landscape of Wales. A
delicate silver-grey is spread over most of his pictures, and his method of
expression is powerful and nervous. By preference he has celebrated, both in
oil-paintings and in boldly handled water-colours, the boundless depths of the
sky in its thousand variations of light, now deep blue in broad noon and now
eerily gloomy and disturbed. The fame of being the greatest of English
water-colour painters is his beyond dispute, yet if he had painted in oils
from his youth upwards he would probably have become the most important
English landscapist. His small pictures are pure and delicate in colour, and
fresh and breezy in atmospheric effect. It is only in large pictures that power
is at times denied him. In his later years he began to paint in oils, and in this
medium he is a less important artist, though a very great painter. <i>William
Müller</i>, who died young, stood as leader at his side.</p>

<p>He was one of the most dexterous amongst the dexterous, next to Turner the
greatest adept of English painting. Had he been simpler and quieter he might
be called a genius of the first order. But he has sometimes a touch of what is
theatrical; it does not always break out, but it does so occasionally. He has
an inclination for pageantry, and nothing of that self-sufficiency and quiet
tenderness with which Constable and Cox devoted themselves to home scenery.
He was at pains to give a trace of largeness and sublimity to modest and
unpretentious English landscape, to give to the most familiar subject a tinge
of preciosity. His pictures are grandiose in form, and show an admirable
lightness of hand, but light and air are wanting in them, the local colour of
England and its atmosphere. As a foreigner&mdash;he was the son of a Danzig
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>290</span>
scholar, who had migrated to Bristol&mdash;Müller has not seen English landscape
with Constable&rsquo;s native sentiment. He was not content with an English
cornfield or an English village; the familiar homeliness of the country in its
work-a-day garb excited no emotion in him.</p>

<p>Something in Müller&rsquo;s imagination, which caused him to love decided
colours and sudden contrasts rather than delicate gradations, attracted him
to Southern climes. His natural place was in the East, which had not at that
time been made the vogue. Here, like Decamps and Marilhat, he found those
vivid rather than delicate effects which appealed to his eye. He was twice
in the South&mdash;the first time in Athens and Egypt in 1838, and once again in
Smyrna, Rhodes, and Lycia in 1843-44. In the year during which he had yet
to live he collected those Oriental pictures which form his legacy, containing
the best that he did. Certain of them, such as &ldquo;The Amphitheatre at
Xanthus,&rdquo; are painted with marvellous verve; they are not the work of a day,
but of an hour. All these mountain castles upon abrupt cliffs, these views of
the Acropolis and of Egypt, are real masterpieces of broad painting, their
colour clear and their light admirable. Not one of the many Frenchmen who
were in the South at this time has represented its sunshine and its brilliant
atmosphere with such flattering, voluptuous tones.</p>

<p><i>Peter de Wint</i>, who was far more true and simple, was, like Constable and
Cox, entirely wedded to his own birthplace. At any rate, his sojourn in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>291</span>
France lasted only for a short time, and left no traces in his art. From youth
to age he was the painter of England in its work-a-day garb&mdash;of the low hills
of Surrey, of the plains of Lincolnshire, or of the dark canals of the Thames,
which he specially portrayed in unsurpassable water-colour paintings. His
ancestor in art is Philips de Koning, the pupil of Rembrandt, the master of
Dutch plains and wide horizons.</p>

<p>After Cox and de Wint came <i>Creswick</i>, more laborious, more patient, more
studious of detail, furnished perhaps with a sharper eye for the green tones of
nature, though with less feeling for atmosphere. It cannot be said that he
advanced art, but merely that he added a regard for light and sunshine,
unknown to the period before 1820, to the study of Hobbema and Waterloo.
With those who would not have painted as they did but for Constable, <i>Peter
Graham</i> and <i>Dawson</i> may be likewise ranked; and these artists peculiarly
devoted themselves to the study of sky and water. Henry Dawson painted
the most paltry and unpromising places&mdash;a reach of the Thames close to
London, or a quarter in the smoky precincts of Dover, or Greenwich; but
he painted them with a
power such as only Constable
possessed. In particular
he is unequalled
in his masterly painting
of clouds. Constable had
seldom done this in the
same way. He delighted
in an agitated sky, in
clouds driven before the
wind and losing their form
in indeterminate contours;
in nature he saw merely
reflections of his own restless
spirit, striving after
colour and movement.
Dawson painted those
clouds which stand firm
in the sky like piles of
building&mdash;cloud-cathedrals,
as Ruskin has called them.
There are pictures of his
consisting of almost nothing
but great clouds. But
that wide space, the earth,
which our eyes regard as
their own peculiar domain,
is wanting. Colours and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>292</span>
forms are nowhere to be seen, but only clouds and undulating yellowish
mist in which objects vanish like pallid spectres. <i>John Linnell</i> carried the
traditions of this great era on to the new period: at first revelling in golden
light, in sunsets and rosy clouds of dusk, and at a later time, in the manner of
the Pre-Raphaelites, bent on the precise execution of bodily form.</p>

<p>The young master, who died at twenty-seven, <i>Richard Parkes Bonington</i>,
unites these English classic masters with the French. An Englishman by
birth and origin, but trained as a painter in France, where he had gone when
fifteen years of age, he seems from many points of view one of the most gracious
products of the Romantic movement in France, though at the same time he
has qualities over which only the English had command at that period, and
not the French. He entered Gros&rsquo;s studio in France, which was then the
favourite meeting-place of all the younger men of revolutionary tendencies,
but repeated journeys to London did not allow him to forget Constable. In
Normandy and Picardy he painted his first landscapes, following them up
with a series of Venetian sea-pieces and little historical scenes. Then consumption
seized him and took but a brief time in striking him down. On
23rd September 1828 he died in London, whither he had gone to consult a
specialist. In consequence of his early death his talent never ripened, but
he was a simple, natural, pure, and congenial artist for all that. &ldquo;I knew
him well and loved him much. His English composure, which nothing could
disturb, robbed him of none of the qualities which make life pleasant. When
I first came across him I was myself very young, and was making studies in the
Louvre. It was about 1816 or 1817. He was in the act of copying a Flemish
landscape&mdash;a tall youth who had grown rapidly. He had already an astonishing
dexterity in water-colours, which were then an English novelty. Some
which I saw later at a dealer&rsquo;s were charming, both in colour and composition.
Other modern artists are perhaps more powerful and more accurate than
Bonington, but no one in this modern school, perhaps no earlier artist,
possessed the ease of execution which makes his works, in a certain sense,
diamonds by which the eye is pleased and fascinated, quite independently
of the subject and the particular representation of nature. And the same
is true of the costume pictures which he painted later. Even here I could
never grow weary of marvelling at his sense of effect, and his great ease of
execution. Not that he was quickly satisfied; on the contrary, he often
began over again perfectly finished pieces which seemed wonderful to us.
But his dexterity was so great that in a moment he produced with his brush
new effects, which were as charming as the first.&rdquo; With these words his
friend and comrade, the great Eugène Delacroix, drew the portrait of Bonington.
Bonington was at once the most natural and the most delicate in that Romantic
school in which he was one of the first to make an appearance. He had a fine
eye for the charm of nature, saw grace and beauty in her everywhere, and
represented the spring and the sunshine in bright and clear tones. No Frenchman
before him has so painted the play of light on gleaming costumes and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>293</span>
succulent meadow grasses. Even his lithographs from Paris and the provinces
are masterpieces of spirited, impressionist observation&mdash;qualities which he
owed, not to Gros, but to Constable. He was the first to communicate the
knowledge of the great English classic painters to the youth of France, and
they of Barbizon and Ville d&rsquo;Avray continued to spin the threads which
connect Constable with the present.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">That</span> same Salon of 1822 in which Delacroix exhibited his &ldquo;Dante&rsquo;s
Bark&rdquo; brought to Frenchmen a knowledge of the powerful movement
which had taken place on the opposite side of the Channel. English water-colour
painting was brilliantly represented by Bonington, who sent his &ldquo;View
of Lillebonne&rdquo; and his &ldquo;View of Havre.&rdquo; Copley Fielding, Robson, and
John Varley also contributed works; and these easy, spirited productions,
with their skies washed in broadly and their bright, clear tones, were like a
revelation to the young French artists of the period. The horizon was felt to
be growing clear. In 1824, at the time when Delacroix&rsquo;s &ldquo;Massacre of Chios&rdquo;
appeared, the sun actually rose, bringing a flood of light. The English had
learnt the way to France, and took the Louvre by storm. John Constable
was represented by three pictures, and Bonington, Copley Fielding, Harding,
Samuel Prout, and Varley were also accorded a place. This exhibition gave
the deathblow to Classical landscape painting. Michallon had died young in
1822; and men like Bidault and Watelet could do nothing against such a
battalion of colourists. Constable alone passed sentence upon them of eternal
condemnation. Familiar neither with Georges Michel nor with the great
Dutch painters, the French had not remarked that a landscape has need of
a sky expressive of the spirit of the hour and the character of the season.
Even what was done by Michel seemed a kind of diffident calligraphy when set
beside the fresh strand-pieces of Bonington, the creations of the water-colour
artists, bathed as they were in light, and the bold pictures of the Bergholt
master, with their bright green and their cloudy horizon. The French landscape
painters, who had been so timid until then, recognised that their painting
had been a convention, despite all their striving after truth to nature.</p>

<p>Constable had been the first to free himself from every stereotyped rule,
and he was an influence in France. The younger generation were in ecstasies
over this intense green, the agitated clouds, this effervescent power inspiring
everything with life. Though as yet but little esteemed even in England,
Constable received the gold medal in Paris, and from that time took a fancy to
Parisian exhibitions, and still in 1827 exhibited in the Louvre by the side of
Bonington, who had but one year more in which to give admirable lessons by
his bright plains and clear shining skies. At the same time Bonington&rsquo;s
friend and compatriot, William Reynolds, then likewise domiciled in Paris,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>295</span>
contributed some of his powerful and often delicate landscape studies, the
tender grey notes of which are like anticipations of Corot. This influence of
the English upon the creators of <i>paysage intime</i> has long been an acknowledged
fact, since Delacroix himself, in his article &ldquo;Questions sur le Beau&rdquo; in the
<i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i> in 1854, has affirmed it frankly.</p>

<p>The very next years announced what a ferment Constable had stirred in
the more restless spirits. The period from 1827 to 1830 showed the birth-throes
of French landscape painting. In 1831 it was born. In this year, for
ever marked in the annals of French, and indeed of European art, there appeared
together in the Salon, for the first time, all those young artists who are now
honoured as the greatest in the century: all, or almost all, were children of
Paris, the sons of small townsmen or of humble artisans; all were born in the
old quarter of the city or in its suburbs, in the midst of a desolate wilderness
of houses, and destined for that very reason to be great landscape painters.
For it is not through chance that <i>paysage intime</i> immediately passed from
London, the city of smoke, to Paris, the second great modern capital, and
reached Germany from thence only at a much later time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember the time,&rdquo; asks Bürger-Thoré of Théodore Rousseau
in the dedicatory letter to his <i>Salon</i> of 1844,&mdash;&ldquo;do you still recall the years
when we sat on the window-ledges of our attics in the Rue de Taitbout, and
let our feet dangle at the edge of the roof, contemplating the chaos of houses
and chimneys, which you with a
twinkle in your eye compared to
mountains, trees, and outlines of the
earth? You were not able to go to
the Alps, into the cheerful country,
and so you created picturesque
landscapes for yourself out of these
horrible skeletons of wall. Do you
still recall the little tree in Rothschild&rsquo;s
garden, which we caught
sight of between two roofs? It was
the one green thing that we could
see; every fresh shoot of the little
poplar wakened our interest in
spring, and in autumn we counted
the falling leaves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From this mood sprang modern
landscape painting with its delicate
reserve in subject, and its vigorously
heightened love of nature. Up to
the middle of the century nature
was too commonplace and ordinary
for the Germans; and it was therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>296</span>
hard for them to establish a spiritual relationship with her. Landscape
painting recognised its function in appealing to the understanding by the
execution of points of geographical interest, or exciting a frigid curiosity
by brilliant fireworks. But these children of the city, who with a heartfelt
sympathy counted the budding and falling leaves of a single tree descried
from their little attic window; these dreamers, who in their imagination
constructed beautiful landscapes from the moss-crusted gutters of the roof
and the chimneys and chimney smoke, were sufficiently schooled, when
they came into the country, to feel the breath of the great mother of all,
even where it was but faintly exhaled. Where a man&rsquo;s heart is full he
does not think about geographical information, and no roll of tom-toms
is needed to attract the attention of those whose eyes are opened. Their
spirit was sensitive, and their imagination sufficiently alert to catch with
ecstasy, even from the most delicate and reserved notes, the harmony of that
heavenly concert which nature executes on all its earthly instruments, at every
moment and in all places.</p>

<p>Thus they had none of them any further need for extensive pilgrimage;
to seek impulse for work they had not far to go. Croissy, Bougival, Saint-Cloud,
and Marly were their Arcadia. Their farthest journeys were to the
banks of the Oise, the woods of L&rsquo;Isle Adam, Auvergne, Normandy, and
Brittany. But they cared most of all to stay in the forest of Fontainebleau,
which&mdash;by one of those curious chances that so often recur in history&mdash;played
for a second time a highly important part in the development of French art.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>297</span>
A hundred years before, it was the brilliant centre of the French Renaissance,
the resort of those Italian artists who found in the palace there a second
Vatican, and in Francis <span class="sc">I</span> another Leo <span class="sc">X</span>. In the nineteenth century, too,
the Renaissance of French painting was achieved in Fontainebleau, only it had
nothing to do with a school of mannered figure painters, but with a group of the
most delicate landscape artists. From a sense of one&rsquo;s duty to art one studies
in the palace the elegant goddesses of Primaticcio, the laughing bacchantes of
Cellini, and all the golden, festal splendour of the Cinquecento; but the heart
is not touched till one stands outside in the forest on the soil where Rousseau
and Corot and Millet and Diaz painted. How much may be felt and thought
when one saunters of a dreamy evening, lost in one&rsquo;s own meditations, across
the heath of the <i>plateau de la Belle Croix</i> and through the arching oaks of
<i>Bas Bréau</i> to Barbizon, the Mecca of modern art, where the secrets of <i>paysage
intime</i> were revealed to the Parisian landscape painters by the nymph of
Fontainebleau! There was a time when men built their Gothic cathedrals
soaring into the sky, after the model of the majestic palaces of the trees. The
dim and sacred mist of incense hovered about the lofty pointed arches, and
through painted windows the broken daylight shone, inspiring awe; the fair
picture of a saint beckoned from above the altar, touched by the gleam of
lamps and candles; gilded carvings glimmered strangely, and overwhelming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>298</span>
strains from the fugues of Bach reverberated in the peal of the organ
throughout the consecrated space. But now the Gothic cathedrals are
transformed once more into palaces of trees. The towering oaks are
the buttresses, the tracery of branches the choir screen, the clouds the
incense, the wind sighing through the boughs the peal of the organ, and
the sun the altar-piece. Man is once more a fire-worshipper, as in his childhood;
the church has become the world, and the world has become the
church.</p>

<p>How the spirit soars at the trill of a blackbird beneath the leafy roof of
mighty primæval oaks! One feels as though one had been transplanted into
the Saturnian age, when men lived a joyous, unchequered life in holy unison
with nature. For this park is still primæval, in spite of all the carriage roads
by which it is now traversed, in spite of all the guides who lounge upon the
granite blocks of the hollows of Opremont. Yellowish-green ferns varying in
tint cover the soil like a carpet. The woods are broken by great wastes of
rock. Perhaps there is no spot in the world where such splendid beeches and
huge majestic oaks stretch their gnarled branches to the sky&mdash;in one place
spreading forth in luxuriant glory, and in another scarred by lightning and
bitten by the wintry cold. It is just such scenes of ravage that make the
grandest, the wildest, and the most sombre pictures. The might of the great
forces of nature, striking down the heads of oaks like thistles, is felt nowhere
in the same degree.</p>

<p>Barbizon itself is a small village three miles to the north of Fontainebleau,
and, according to old tradition, founded by robbers who formerly dwelt in
the forest. On both sides of the road connecting it with the charming little
villages of Dammarie and Chailly there stretch long rows of chestnut, apple,
and acacia trees. There are barely a hundred houses in the place. Most of
them are overgrown with wild vine, shut in by thick hedges of hawthorn, and
have a garden in front, where roses bloom amid cabbages and cauliflowers. At
nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening all Barbizon is asleep, but before four in the morning
it awakes once more for work in the fields.</p>

<p>Historians of after-years will occupy themselves in endeavouring to discover
when the first immigration of Parisian painters to this spot took place. It
is reported that one of David&rsquo;s pupils painted in the forest of Fontainebleau
and lived in Barbizon. The only lodging to be got at that time was in a barn,
which the former tailor of the place, a man of the name of Ganne, turned into
an inn in 1823. Here, after 1830, Corot, Rousseau, Diaz, Brascassat, and
many others alighted when they came to follow their studies in Barbizon from
the spring to the autumn. Of an evening they clambered up to their miserable
bedroom, and fastened to the head of the bed with drawing-pins the studies
made in the course of the day. It was only later that Père Copain, an old
peasant, who had begun life as a shepherd with three francs a month, was
struck with the apt idea of buying in a few acres and building upon them
small houses to let to painters. By this enterprise the man became rich, and
gradually grew to be a capitalist, lending money to all who, in spite of their
standing as celebrated Parisian artists, did not enjoy the blessings of fortune.
But the general place of assembly was still the old barn employed in Ganne&rsquo;s
establishment, and in the course of years its walls were covered with large
charcoal drawings, studies, and pictures. Here, in a patriarchal, easy-going,
homely fashion, artists gathered together with their wives and children of an
evening. Festivities also were held in the place, in particular that ball when
Ganne&rsquo;s daughter, a godchild of Madame Rousseau, celebrated her wedding.
Rousseau and Millet were the decorators of the room; the entire space of
the barn served as ball-room, the walls being adorned with ivy. Corot,
always full of fun and high spirits, led the polonaise, which moved through
a labyrinth of bottles placed on the floor.</p>

<p>They painted in the forest. But they did not take the trouble to carry
the instruments of their art home again. They kept breakfast, canvas, and
brushes in holes in the rocks. Never before, probably, have men so lost
themselves in nature. At every hour of the day, in the cool light of morning,
at sunny noon, in the golden dusk, even in the twilight of blue moonlight
nights, they were out in the field and the forest, learning to surprise everlasting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>302</span>
nature at every moment of her mysterious life. The forest was their studio,
and revealed to them all its secrets.</p>

<p>The result of this life <i>en plein air</i> became at once the same as it had been
with Constable. Earlier artists worked with the conception and the technique
of Waterloo, Ruysdael, and Everdingen, and believed themselves incapable of
doing anything without gnarled, heroic oaks. Even Michel was hard-bound
in the gallery style of the Dutch, and for Decamps atmosphere was still a thing
unknown or non-existent. He placed a harsh light, opaque as plaster, against
a background as black as coal. Even the colours of Delacroix were merely
tones of the palette; he wanted to create preconceived decorative harmonies,
and not simply to interpret reality. Following the English, the masters
of Fontainebleau made the discovery of air and light. They did not paint
the world, like the other Romanticists, in exuberantly varying hues recalling
the old masters: they saw it <i>entouré d&rsquo;air</i>, and tempered by the tones of the
atmosphere. And since their time the &ldquo;harmony of light and air with that
of which they are the life and illumination&rdquo; has become the great problem of
painting. Through this art grew young again, and works of art received the
breathing life, the fresh bloom, and the delicate harmony which are to be found
everywhere in nature itself, and which are only reached with much difficulty by
any artificial method of tuning into accord. After Constable they were the first
who recognised that the beauty of a landscape does not lie in objects themselves,
but in the lights that are cast upon them. Of course, there is also an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>303</span>
articulation of forms in nature. When Boecklin paints a grove with tall and
solemn trees in the evening, when he forms to himself a vision of the mysterious
haunts of his &ldquo;Fire-worshippers,&rdquo; there is scarcely any need of colour. The
outline alone is so majestically stern that it makes man feel his littleness
utterly, and summons him to devotional thoughts. But the subtle essence
by which nature appeals either joyously or sorrowfully to the spirit depends
still more on the light or gloom in which she is bathed; and this mood is not
marked by an inquisitive eye: the introspective gaze, the imagination itself,
secretes it in nature. And here a second point is touched.</p>

<p>The peculiarity of all these masters, who on their first appearance were
often despised as realists or naturalists, consists precisely in this: they never
represented, at least in the works of their later period in which they thoroughly
expressed themselves,&mdash;they never represented actual nature in the manner of
photography, but freely painted their own moods from memory, just as
Goethe when he stood in the little house in the Kikelhahn near Ilmenau,
instead of elaborating a prosaic description of the Kikelhahn, wrote the verses
<i>Ueber allen Wipfeln ist Ruh</i>. In this poem of Goethe one does not learn how
the summits looked, and there is no allusion to the play of light, and yet the
forest, dimly illuminated by the rays of the setting sun, is presented clearly to
the inward eye. Any poet before Goethe&rsquo;s time would have made a broad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>304</span>
and epical description, and produced a picture by the addition of details;
but here the very music of the words creates a picture of rest and quietude.
The works of the Fontainebleau artists are Goethe-like poems of nature in
pigments. They are as far removed from the æsthetic aridness of the older
landscape of composition, pieced together from studies, as from the flat,
prosaic fidelity to nature of that &ldquo;entirely null and void, spuriously realistic
painting of the so-called guardians of woods and waters.&rdquo; They were
neither concerned to master nature and compose a picture from her according
to conventional rules, nor pedantically to draw the portrait of any given
region. They did not think of topographical accuracy, or of preparing a map
of their country. A landscape was not for them a piece of scenery, but a
condition of soul. They represent the victory of lyricism over dry though
inflated prose. Impressed by some vision of nature, they warm to their work
and produce pictures that could not have been anticipated. And thus they
fathomed art to its profoundest depths. Their works were fragrant poems
sprung from moods of spirit which had risen in them during a walk in the
forest. Perhaps only Titian, Rubens, and Watteau had previously looked upon
nature with the same eyes. And as in the case of these artists, so also in that
of the Fontainebleau painters, it was necessary that a genuine realistic art,
a long period of the most intimate study of nature, should have to be gone
through before they reached this height.</p>

<p>In the presence of nature one saturates one&rsquo;s self with truth; and after
returning to the studio one squeezes the sponge, as Jules Dupré expressed it.
Only after they had satiated themselves with the knowledge of truth, only
after nature with all her individual phenomena had been interwoven with their
inmost being, could they, without effort, and without the purpose of representing
determined objects, paint from personal sentiment, and give expression
to their humour, in the mere gratification of impulse. Thence comes their
wide difference from each other. Painters who work according to fixed rules
resemble one another, and those who aim at a distinct copy of nature resemble
one another no less. But each one of the Fontainebleau painters, according
to his character and his mood for the time being, received different impressions
from the same spot in nature, and at the same moment of time. Each found
a landscape and a moment which appealed to his sentiment more perceptibly
than any other. One delighted in spring and dewy morning, another in a
cold, clear day, another in the threatening majesty of storm, another in the
sparkling effects of sportive sunbeams, and another in evening after sundown,
when colours have faded and forms are dim. Each one obeyed his peculiar
temperament, and adapted his technique to the altogether personal expression
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>306</span>
of his way of seeing and feeling. Each one is entirely himself, each one an
original mind, each picture a spiritual revelation, and often one of touching
simplicity and greatness: <i>homo additus naturæ</i>. And having dedicated themselves,
more than all their predecessors, to personality creating in and for
itself, they have become the founders of the new creed in art.</p>

<p>That strong and firmly rooted master <i>Théodore Rousseau</i> was the epic
poet, the plastic artist of the Pleïades. &ldquo;<i>Le chêne des roches</i>&rdquo; was one of his
masterpieces, and he stands himself amid the art of his time like an oak
embedded in rocks. His father was a tailor who lived in the Rue Neuve-Saint
Eustache, Nr. 4 <i>au quatrième</i>. As a boy he is said to have specially
devoted himself to mathematics, and to have aimed at becoming a student at
the Polytechnic Institute. Thus the dangerous, doctrinaire tendency, which
beset him in his last years, of making art more of a science than is really
practicable, and of referring everything to some law, lay even in his boyish
tastes. He grew up in the studio of the Classicist Lethière, and looked on
whilst the latter painted both his large Louvre pictures, &ldquo;The Death of
Brutus&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Death of Virginia.&rdquo; He even thought himself of competing
for the <i>Prix de Rome</i>. But the composition of his &ldquo;historical landscape&rdquo;
was not a success. Then he took his paint-boxes, left Lethière&rsquo;s studio, and
wandered over to Montmartre. Even his first little picture, &ldquo;The Telegraph
Tower&rdquo; of 1826, announced the
aim which he was tentatively
endeavouring to reach.</p>

<p>At the very time when Watelet&rsquo;s
metallic waterfalls and
zinc trees were being drawn up
in line, when the pupils of Bertin
hunted the Calydonian boar, or
drowned Zenobia in the waves
of the Araxes, Rousseau, set
free from the ambition of winning
the <i>Prix de Rome</i>, was
painting humble plains within
the precincts of Paris, with little
brooks in the neighbourhood
which had nothing that deserved
the name of waves.</p>

<p>His first excursion to Fontainebleau
occurred in the year
1833, and in 1834 he painted his
first masterpiece, the &ldquo;Côtés de
Grandville,&rdquo; that picture, replete
with deep and powerful feeling
for nature, which seems the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>307</span>
triumphant title-page of all his work. A firm resolve to accept reality as it
is, and a remarkable eye for the local character of landscape and for the
structure and anatomy of the earth&mdash;all qualities revealing the Rousseau of
later years&mdash;were here to be seen in their full impressiveness and straightforward
actuality. He received for this work a medal of the third class. At
the same time his works were excluded from making any further appearance
in the Salon for many years to come. Concession might be made to a beginner;
but the master seemed dangerous to the academicians. Two pictures, &ldquo;Cows
descending in the Upper Jura&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Chestnut Avenue,&rdquo; which he had
destined for the Salon of 1835, were rejected by the hanging committee, and
during twelve years his works met with a similar fate, although the leading
critical intellects of Paris, Thoré, Gustave Planché, and Théophile Gautier,
broke their lances in his behalf. Amongst the rejected of the present century,
Théodore Rousseau is probably the most famous. At that period he was
selling his pictures for five and ten louis-d&rsquo;or. It was only after the February
Revolution of 1848, when the Academic Committee had fallen with the <i>bourgeois</i>
king, that the doors of the Salon were opened to him again, and in the meanwhile
his pictures had made their way quietly and by their unassisted merit.
In the sequestered solitude of Barbizon he had matured into an artistic
individuality of the highest calibre, and become a painter to whom the history
of art must accord a place by the side of Ruysdael, Hobbema, and Constable.</p>

<p>He painted everything in Barbizon&mdash;the plains and the hills, the river
and the forest, all the seasons of the year and all the hours of the day. The
succession of his moods is as inexhaustible as boundless nature herself. Skies
gilded by the setting sun, phases of dewy morning, plains basking in light, woods
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>308</span>
in the russet-yellow foliage of autumn: these are the subjects of Théodore
Rousseau&mdash;an endless procession of poetic effects, expressed at first by the
mere instinct of emotion and later with a mathematical precision which is
often a little strained, though always irresistibly forcible. Marvellous are his
autumn landscapes with their ruddy foliage of beech; majestic are those
pictures in which he expressed the profound sentiment of solitude as it passes
over you in the inviolate tangle of the forest, inviting the spirit to commune
with itself; but especially characteristic of Rousseau are those plains with
huge isolated trees, over which the mere light of common day rests almost
coldly and dispassionately.</p>

<p>It is an artistic or psychological anomaly that in this romantic generation
a man could be born in whom there was nothing of the Romanticist. Théodore
Rousseau was an experimentalist, a great worker, a restless and seeking spirit,
ever tormented and unsatisfied with itself, a nature wholly without sentimentality
and impassionless, the very opposite of his predecessor Huet.
Huet made nature the mirror of the passions, the melancholy and the tragic
suffering which agitate the human spirit with their rage. Whilst he celebrated
the irresistible powers and blind forces, the elemental genii which rule the
skies and the waters, he wanted to waken an impression of terror and desolation
in the spirit of the beholder. He piled together masses of rock, lent dramatic
passion to the clouds, and revelled with delight in the sharpest contrasts.
Rousseau&rsquo;s pervasive characteristic
is absolute plainness and actuality.
Such a simplicity of shadow had
never existed before. Since the
Renaissance artists had systematically
heightened the intensity
of shadows for the sake of effect;
Rousseau relied on the true and
simple doctrine that may be formulated
in the phrase: the more light
there is the fainter and more transparent
are the shadows, not the
darker, as Decamps and Huet
painted them. Or, to speak more
generally, in nature the intensity
of shadows stands in an inverse
relation to the intensity of the
light.</p>

<p>Rousseau does not force on the
spectator any preconceived mood of
his own, but leaves him before a
picture with all the freedom and
capacity for personal feeling which
he would have received from
the spectacle of nature herself.
The painter does not
address him directly, but lets
nature have free play, just
as a medium merely acts as
the vehicle of a spirit. So
personal in execution and
so absolutely impersonal in
conception are Rousseau&rsquo;s
pictures. Huet translated his
moods by the assistance of
nature; Rousseau is an incomparable
witness, confining
himself strictly to the event,
and giving his report of it in
brief, virile speech, in clear-cut
style. Huet puts one
out of humour, because it is
his own humour which he is
determined to force. Rousseau
seldom fails of effect,
because he renders the effect
which has struck him, faithfully
and without marginal notes. Only in the convincing power of representation,
and never in the forcing of a calculated mood, does the &ldquo;mood&rdquo;
of his landscape lie. Or, to take an illustration from the province of portrait
painting, when Lenbach paints Prince Bismarck, it is Lenbach&rsquo;s Bismarck;
as an intellectual painter he has given an entirely subjective rendering of
Bismarck, and compels the spectator so to see him. Holbein, when he painted
Henry <span class="sc">VIII</span>, proceeded in the opposite way: for him characterisation depended
on his revealing his own character as little as possible; he completely subordinated
himself to his subject, surrendered himself, and religiously painted all
that he saw, leaving it to others to carry away from the picture what they
pleased. And Théodore Rousseau, too, was possessed by the spirit of the old
German portrait painter. He set his whole force of purpose to the task of
letting nature manifest herself, free from any preconceived interpretation.
His pictures are absolutely without effective point, but there is so much power
and deep truth, so much simplicity, boldness, and sincerity in his manner of
seeing and painting nature, and of feeling her intense and forceful life, that
they have become great works of art by this alone, like the portraits of Holbein.
More impressive tones, loftier imagination, more moving tenderness, and more
intoxicating harmonies are at the command of other masters, but few had
truer or more profound articulation, and not one has been so sincere as Théodore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>310</span>
Rousseau. Rousseau saw into the inmost being of nature, as Holbein into
Henry <span class="sc">VIII</span>, and the impression he received, the emotion he felt, is a thing
which he communicates broadly, boldly, and entirely. He is a portrait
painter who knows his model through and through; moreover, he is a connoisseur
of the old masters who knows what it is to make a picture. Every
production of Rousseau is a deliberate and well-considered work, a cannon-shot,
and no mere dropping fusilade of small arms; not a light <i>feuilleton</i>, but
an earnest treatise of strong character. Though a powerful colourist, he
works by the simplest means, and has at bottom the feeling of a draughtsman;
which is principally the reason why, at the present day, when one looks
at Rousseau&rsquo;s pictures, one thinks rather of Hobbema than of Billotte and
Claude Monet.</p>

<p>His absolute mastery over drawing even induced him in his last years to
abandon painting altogether. He designated it contemptuously as falsehood,
because it smeared over the truth, the anatomy of nature.</p>

<p>In Rousseau there was even more the genius of a sculptor than of a portrait
painter. His spirit, positive, exact, like that of a mathematician, and far
more equipped with artistic
precision than pictorial qualities,
delighted in everything
sharply defined, plastic, and
full of repose: moss-grown
stones, oaks of the growth of
centuries, marshes and standing
water, rude granite blocks
of the forest of Fontainebleau,
and trees bedded in the rocks
of the glens of Opremont.
In a quite peculiar sense was
the oak his favourite tree&mdash;the
mighty, wide-branching,
primæval oak which occupies
the centre of one of his
masterpieces, &ldquo;A Pond,&rdquo; and
spreads its great gnarled
boughs to the cloudy sky in
almost every one of his pictures.
It is only Rembrandt&rsquo;s
three oaks that stand in like
manner, firm and broad of
stem, as though they were
living personalities of the
North, in a lonely field beneath
the hissing rain. To
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>311</span>
ensure the absolute vitality of organisms was for Rousseau the object of
unintermittent toil.</p>

<p>Plants, trees, and rocks were not forms summarily observed and clumped
together in an arbitrary fashion; for him they were beings gifted with a soul,
breathing creatures, each one of which had its physiognomy, its individuality,
its part to play, and its distinction of being in the great harmony of universal
nature. &ldquo;By the harmony of air and light with that of which they are the life
and the illumination I will make you hear the trees moaning beneath the
North wind and the birds calling to their young.&rdquo; To achieve that aim he
thought that he could not do too much. As Dürer worked seven times on
the same scenes of the Passion until he had found the simplest and most
speaking expression, so Rousseau treated the same motives ten and twenty
times. Restless are his efforts to discover different phases of the same subject,
to approach his model from the most various points of view, and to do justice
to it on every side. He begins an interrupted picture again and again, and
adds something to it to heighten the expression, as Leonardo died with the
consciousness that there was something yet to be done to his &ldquo;Joconda.&rdquo;
Sometimes a laboured effect is brought into his works by this method, but
in other ways he has gained in this struggle with reality a power of exposition,
a capacity of expression, a force of appeal, and such a remarkable insight for
rightness of effect that every one of his good pictures could be hung without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>312</span>
detriment in a gallery of old masters; the nineteenth century did not see
many arise who could bear such a proximity in every respect. His landscapes
are as full of sap as creation itself; they reveal a forcible condensation
of nature. The only words which can be used to describe him are strength,
health, and energy. &ldquo;It ought to be: in the beginning was the Power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From his youth upwards Théodore Rousseau was a masculine spirit;
even as a stripling he was a man above all juvenile follies&mdash;one might almost
say, a philosopher without ideals. In literature Turgenief&rsquo;s conception of
nature might be most readily compared with that of Rousseau. In Turgenief&rsquo;s
<i>Diary of a Sportsman</i>, written in 1852, everything is so fresh and full of sap
that one could imagine it was not so much the work of a human pen as a
direct revelation from the forest and the steppes. Though men are elsewhere
habituated to see their joys and sorrows reflected in nature, the sentiment
of his own personality falls from Turgenief when he contemplates the eternal
spectacle of the elements. He plunges into nature and loses the consciousness
of his own being in hers; and he becomes a part of what he contemplates.
For him the majesty of nature lies in her treating everything, from the worm
to the human being, with impassiveness. Man receives neither love nor
hatred at her hands; she neither rejoices in the good that he does nor complains
of sin and crime, but looks beyond him with her deep, earnest eyes
because he is an object of complete indifference to her. &ldquo;The last of thy
brothers might vanish off the face of the earth and not a needle of the pine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>313</span>
branches would tremble.&rdquo; Nature has something icy, apathetic, terrible;
and the fear which she can inspire through this indifference of hers ceases
only when we begin to understand the relationship in which we are to our
surroundings, when we begin to comprehend that man and animal, tree and
flower, bird and fish, owe their existence to this one Mother. So Turgenief
came to the same point as Spinoza.</p>

<p>And Rousseau did the same. The nature of Théodore Rousseau was
devoid of all excitable enthusiasm. Thus the world he painted became
something austere, earnest, and inaccessible beneath his hands. He lived
in it alone, fleeing from his fellows, and for this reason human figures are
seldom to be found in his pictures. He loved to paint nature on cold, grey
impassive days, when the trees cast great shadows and forms stand out
forcibly against the sky. He is not the painter of morning and evening
twilight. There is no awakening and no dawn, no charm in these landscapes
and no youth. Children would not laugh here, nor lovers venture to caress.
In these trees the birds would build no nests, nor their fledglings twitter.
His oaks stand as if they had so stood from eternity.</p>

<p>He familiarised himself more and more with the endless variety of plants
and trees, of the earth and the sky at the differing hours of the day: he made
his forms even more precise. He wished to paint the organic life of inanimate
nature&mdash;the life which heaves unconsciously everywhere, sighing in the air,
streaming from the bosom of the earth, and vibrating in the tiniest blade of
grass as positively as it palpitates through the branches of the old oaks. These
trees and herbs are not human, but they are characterised by their peculiar
features, just as though they were men. The poplars grow like pyramids,
and have green and silvered leaves, the oaks dark foliage and gnarled far-reaching
boughs. The oaks stand fixed and immovable against the storm,
whilst the slender poplars bend pliantly before it. This curious distinction
in all the forms of nature, each one of which fulfils a course of existence like
that of man, was a problem which pursued Rousseau throughout his life as
a vast riddle. Observe his trees: they are not dead things; the sap of life
mounts unseen through their strong trunks to the smallest branches and
shoots, which spread from the extremity of the boughs like clawing fingers.
The soil works and alters; every plant reveals the inner structure of the
organism which produced it. And this striving even became a curse to him
in his last period. Nature became for him an organism which he studied as
an anatomist studies a corpse, an organism all the members of which act one
upon the other according to logical laws, like the wheels of a machine; and for
the proper operation of this machine the smallest plants seemed as necessary
as the mightiest oaks, the gravel as important as the most tremendous rock.</p>

<p>Convinced that there was nothing in nature either indifferent or without
its purpose, and that everything had a justification for its existence and
played a part in the movement of universal life, he believed also that in
everything, however small it might be, there was a special pictorial significance;
and he toiled to discover this, to make it evident, and often forgot
the while that art must make sacrifices if it is to move and charm. In his
boundless veneration for the logical organism of nature he held, as a kind
of categorical imperative, that it was right to give the same importance to
the infinitely small as to the infinitely great. The notion was chimerical,
and it wrecked him. In his last period the only things that will preserve
their artistic reputation are his marvellously powerful drawings. No one
ever had such a feeling for values, and thus he knew how to give his drawings&mdash;quite
apart from their pithy weight of stroke&mdash;an effect of light which was
forcibly striking. Just as admirable were the water-colours produced under
the influence of Japanese picture-books. The pictures of petty detail which
belong to these years have only an historical interest, and that merely because
it is instructive to see how a great genius can deceive himself. One of his
last works, the view of Mont Blanc, with the boundless horizon and the
countless carefully and scrupulously delineated planes of ground, has neither
pictorial beauty nor majesty. In the presence of this bizarre work one feels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>316</span>
astonishment at the artist&rsquo;s endurance and strength of will, but disappointment
at the result. He wanted to win the secret of its being from every
undulation of the ground, from every blade of grass, and from every leaf;
he was anxiously bent upon what he called <i>planimétrie</i>, upon the importance
of horizontal planes, and he accentuated detail and accessory work beyond
measure. His pantheistic faith in nature brought Théodore Rousseau to his
fall. Those who did not know him spoke of his childish stippling and of
the decline of his talent. Those who did know him saw in this stippling
the issue of the same endeavours which poor Charles de la Berge had
made before him, and of the principles on which the landscape of the English
Pre-Raphaelites was being based about this time. If one looks at his
works and then reads his life one almost comes to have for him a kind
of religious veneration. There is something of the martyr in this insatiable
observer, whose life was one long struggle, and to whom the study of the
earth&rsquo;s construction and the anatomy of branches was almost a religion.</p>

<p>At first he had
to struggle for ten
years for bread and
recognition. It seems
hardly credible that
his landscapes, even
after 1848, when they
had obtained entry
into the Salon, were
a source of irritation
there for years,
simply because they
were green. The
public was so accustomed
to brown trees
and brown grass, that
every other colour
in the landscape was
an offence against
decency, and before
a green picture the
Philistine immediately
cried out,
&ldquo;Spinage!&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Allez,
c&rsquo;était dur d&rsquo;ouvrir la
brêche</i>,&rdquo; said he, in
his later years. And
at last, at the World
Exhibition of 1855,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>317</span>
when he had made it clear to Europe who Théodore Rousseau was, the
evening of his life was saddened by pain and illness. He had married
a poor unfortunate creature, a wild child of the forest, the only feminine
being that he had found time to love during his life of toil. After a few
years of marriage she became insane, and whilst he tended her Rousseau
himself fell a victim to an affection of the brain which darkened his last
years. Death came to his release in 1867. As he lay dying his mad wife
danced and trilled to the screaming of her parrot. He rests &ldquo;<i>dans le plain
calme de la nature</i>&rdquo; in the village churchyard at Chailly, near Barbizon,
buried in front of his much-loved forest. Millet erected the headstone&mdash;a
simple cross upon an unhewn block of sandstone, with a tablet of brass
on which are inscribed the words:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Rousseau c&rsquo;est un aigle. Quant à moi, je ne suis qu&rsquo;une alouette qui
pousse de petites chansons dans mes nuages gris.</i>&rdquo; With these words <i>Camille
Corot</i> has indicated the distinction between Rousseau and himself. They
denote the two opposite poles of modern landscape. What attracted the
plastic artists, Rousseau, Ruysdael, and Hobbema&mdash;the relief of objects, the
power of contours, the solidity of forms&mdash;was not Corot&rsquo;s concern. Whilst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>318</span>
Rousseau never spoke about colour with his pupils, but as <i>ceterum censeo</i>
invariably repeated, &ldquo;<i>Enfin, la forme est la première chose à observer</i>,&rdquo; Corot
himself admitted that drawing was not his strong point. When he tried to
paint rocks he was but moderately effective, and all his efforts at drawing
the human figure were seldom crowned with real success, although in his last
years he returned to the task with continuous zeal. Apart from such peculiar
exceptions as that wonderful picture &ldquo;The Toilet,&rdquo; his figures are always
the weakest part of his landscapes, and only have a good effect when in the
background they reveal their delicate outlines, half lost in rosy haze.
He was not much more felicitous with his animals, and in particular there
often appear in his pictures great heavy cows, which are badly planted on
their feet, and which one wishes that he had left out. Amongst trees he
did not care to paint the oak, the favourite tree with all artists who have a
passion for form, nor the chestnut, nor the elm, but preferred to summon,
amid the delicate play of sunbeams, the aspen, the poplar, the alder, the
birch with its white slender stem and its pale, tremulous leaves, and the willow
with its light foliage. In Rousseau a tree is a proud, toughly knotted personality,
a noble, self-conscious creation; in Corot it is a soft tremulous being
rocking in the fragrant air, in which it whispers and murmurs of love and joy.
His favourite season was not the autumn, when the turning leaves, hard as
steel, stand out with firm lines, quiet and motionless, against the clear sky,
but the early spring, when the farthest twigs upon the boughs deck themselves
with little leaves of tender green, which vibrate and quiver with the least
breath of air. He had, moreover, a perfectly wonderful secret of rendering
the effect of the tiny blades of grass and the flowers which grow upon the
meadows in June; he delighted to paint the banks of a stream with tall
bushes bending to the water, and he loved water itself in undetermined clearness
and in the shifting glance of light, leaving it here in shadow and touching
it there with brightness; the sky in the depths beneath wedded to the bright
border of the pool or the vanishing outlines
of the bank, and the clouds floating across
the sky, and here and there embracing a
light shining fragment of the blue. He loved
morning before sunrise, when the white mists
hover over pools like a light veil of gauze,
and gradually disperse as the sun breaks
through, but he had a passion for evening
which was almost greater: he loved the soft
vapours which gather in the gloom, thickening
until they become pale grey velvet
mantles, as peace and rest descend upon the
earth with the drawing on of night.</p>

<p>In contradistinction from Rousseau his
specialty was everything soft and wavering,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>319</span>
everything that has neither
determined form nor sharp
lines, and that, by not appealing
too clearly to the
eye, is the more conducive
to dreamy reveries. It is
not the spirit of a sculptor
that lives in Corot, but that
of a poet, or still better, the
spirit of a musician, since
music is the least plastic of
the arts. It is not surprising
to read in his biography
that, like Watteau, he had
almost a greater passion for
music than for painting, and that when he painted he had always an
old song or an opera aria upon his lips, that when he spoke of his
pictures he had a taste for drawing comparisons from music, and that
he had a season-ticket at the <i>Conservatoire</i>, never missed a concert, and
played upon the violin himself. Indeed, there is something of the tender
note of this instrument in his pictures, which make such a sweetly
solemn appeal through their delicious silver tone. Beside Rousseau, the
plastic artist, Père Corot is an idyllic painter of melting grace; beside
Rousseau, the realist, he seems a dreamy musician; beside Rousseau, the
virile spirit earnestly making experiments in art, he appears like a bashful
schoolgirl in love. Rousseau approached nature in broad daylight, with
screws and levers, as a cool-headed man of science; Corot caressed and
flattered her, sung her wooing love-songs till she descended to meet him
in the twilight hours, and whispered to him, her beloved, the secrets which
Rousseau was unable to wring from her by violence.</p>

<p><i>Corot</i> was sixteen years senior to Rousseau. He still belonged to the
eighteenth century, to the time when, under the dictatorship of David, Paris
transformed herself into imperial Rome. David, Gérard, Guérin, and Prudhon,
artists so different in talent, were the painters whose works met his first eager
glances, and no particular acuteness is needed to recognise in the Nymphs
and Cupids with which Corot in after-years, especially in the evening of his
life, dotted his fragrant landscapes, the direct issue of Prudhon&rsquo;s charming
goddesses, the reminiscences of his youth nourished on the antique. He,
too, was a child of old Paris, with its narrow streets and corners. His father
was a hairdresser in the Rue du Bac, number 37, and had made the acquaintance
of a girl who lived at number 1 in the same street, close to the Pont
Royal, and was shop-girl at a milliner&rsquo;s. He carried on his barber&rsquo;s shop
until 1778, when Camille, the future painter, was two years old. Then
Madame Corot herself undertook the millinery establishment in which she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>320</span>
had once worked. There might be read on the front of the narrow little
house, number 1 of the Rue du Bac, <i>Madame Corot, Marchande de Modes</i>.
M. Corot, a polite and very correct little man, raised the business to great
prosperity. The Tuileries were opposite, and under Napoleon <span class="sc">I</span> Corot became
Court &ldquo;modiste.&rdquo; As such he must have attained a certain celebrity, as
even the theatre took his name in vain. A piece which was then frequently
played at the Comédie Française contains the passage: &ldquo;I have just come
from Corot, but could not speak to him; he was locked up in his private
room occupied in composing a new spring hat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Camille went to the high school in Rouen, and was then destined, according
to the wish of his father, to adopt some serious calling &ldquo;by which money
was to be made.&rdquo; He began his career with a yard-measure in a linen-draper&rsquo;s
establishment, ran through the suburbs of Paris with a book of patterns
under his arm selling cloth&mdash;<i>Couleur olive</i>&mdash;and in his absence of mind made
the clumsiest mistakes. After eight years of opposition his father consented
to his becoming a painter. &ldquo;You will have a yearly allowance of twelve
hundred francs,&rdquo; said old Corot, &ldquo;and if you can live on that you may do as
you please.&rdquo; At the Pont Royal, behind his father&rsquo;s house, he painted his
first picture, amid the tittering of the little dressmaker&rsquo;s apprentices who
looked on with curiosity from the window, but one of whom, Mademoiselle
Rose, remained his dear friend through life. This was in 1823, and twenty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>321</span>
years went by before he returned to French soil in the pictures that he painted.
Victor Bertin became his teacher; in other words, Classicism, style, and
coldness. He sought diligently to do as others; he drew studies, composed
historical landscapes, and painted as he saw the academicians painting around
him. To conclude his orthodox course of training it only remained for him
to make the pilgrimage to Italy, where Claude Lorrain had once painted and
Poussin had invented the historical landscape. In 1825&mdash;when he was twenty-eight&mdash;he
set out with Bertin and Aligny, remained long in Rome, and came
to Naples. The Classicists, whose circle he entered with submissive veneration,
welcomed him for his cheerful, even temper and the pretty songs which he
sang in fine tenor voice. Early every morning he went into the Campagna,
with a colour-box under his arm and a sentimental ditty on his lips, and
there he drew the ruins with an architectural severity, just like Poussin. In
1827, after a sojourn of two years and a half in Italy, he was able to make
an appearance in the Salon with his carefully balanced landscapes. In 1835
and 1843 he stayed again in Italy, and only after this third pilgrimage were
his eyes opened to the charms of French landscape.</p>

<p>One can pass rapidly over this first section of Corot&rsquo;s work. His pictures
of this period are not without merit, but to speak of them with justice they
should be compared with contemporary Classical productions. Then one
finds in them broad and sure drawing, and can recognise a powerful hand
and notice an astonishing increase of ability. Even on his second sojourn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>322</span>
in Italy he painted no longer as an ethnographical student, and no longer
wasted his powers on detail. But it is in the pictures of his last twenty years
that Corot first becomes the Theocritus of the nineteenth century. The
second Corot has spoilt one&rsquo;s enjoyment for the first. But who would care
to pick a quarrel with him on that score! Beside his later pictures how hard
are those studies from Rome, which the dying painter left to the Louvre, and
which, as his maiden efforts, he regarded with great tenderness all through
his life. How little they have of the delicate, harmonious light of his later
works! The great historical landscape with Homer in it, where light and
shadow are placed so trenchantly beside each other, the landscape &ldquo;Aricia,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Saint Jerome in the Desert,&rdquo; the picture of the young girl sitting reading
beside a mountain stream, &ldquo;The Beggar&rdquo; with that team in mad career
which Decamps could not have painted with greater virtuosity,&mdash;they are
all good pictures by the side of those of his contemporaries, but in comparison
with real Corots they are like the exercises of a pupil, in their hard, dry painting,
their black, coarse tones, and their chalky wall of atmosphere. There is
neither breeze nor transparency nor life in the air; the trees are motionless,
and look as if they were heavily cased in iron.</p>

<p>Corot was approaching his fortieth year, an age at which a man&rsquo;s ideas
are generally fixed, when the great revolution of French landscape painting
was accomplished under the influence of the English and of Rousseau.
Trained in academical traditions, he might have remained steadfast in his
own province. To follow the young school he had completely to learn his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>323</span>
art again, and alter his method of treatment with the choice of subjects, and
this casting of his slough demanded another fifteen years. When he passed
from Italian to French landscape, after his return from his third journey to
Rome in 1843, his pictures were still hard and heavy. He had already felt
the influence of Bonington and Constable, by the side of whose works his first
exhibited picture had hung in 1827. But he still lacked the power of rendering
light and air, and his painting had neither softness nor light. Even in
the choice of subject he was still undecided, returning more than once to the
historical landscape and working on it with unequal success. His masterpiece
of 1843, &ldquo;The Baptism of Christ,&rdquo; in the Church of Saint Nicolas du
Chardonnet in Paris, is no more than a delicate imitation of the old masters.
The &ldquo;Christ upon the Mount of Olives&rdquo; of 1844, in the Museum of Langres,
is the first picture which seems like a convert&rsquo;s confession of faith. In the
centre of the picture, before a low hill, Christ kneels upon the ground praying;
His disciples are around Him, and to the right, vanishing in the shadows,
the olive trees stretch their gnarled branches over the darkened way. A
dark blue sky, in which a star is flickering, broods tremulously over the landscape.
One might pass the Christ over unobserved; but for the title He
would be hard to recognise. But the star shining far away, the transparent
clearness of the night sky, the light clouds, and the mysterious shadows
gliding swiftly over the ground,&mdash;these have no more to do with the false and
already announce the true Corot. From this time he found the way on which
he went forward resolute and emancipated.</p>

<p>For five-and-twenty years it was permitted to him to labour in perfect
ripeness, freedom, and artistic independence. One thinks of Corot as though
he had been a child until he was fifty and then first entered upon his adolescence.
Up to 1846 he took from his father the yearly allowance of twelve
hundred francs given him as a student, and in that year, when he received
the Cross of the Legion of Honour, M. Corot doubled the sum for the future,
observing: &ldquo;Well, Camille seems to have talent after all.&rdquo; About the same
time his friends remarked that he went about Barbizon one day more meditatively
than usual. &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; said he to one of them, &ldquo;I am inconsolable.
Till now I had a complete collection of Corots, and it has been broken
to-day, for I have sold one for the first time.&rdquo; And even at seventy-four he
said: &ldquo;How swiftly one&rsquo;s life passes, and how much must one exert one&rsquo;s
self to do anything good!&rdquo; The history of art has few examples to offer of
so long a spring. Corot had the privilege of never growing old; his life was
a continual rejuvenescence. The works which made him Corot are the youthful
works of an old man, the matured creations of a grey-headed artist, who&mdash;like
Titian&mdash;remained for ever young; and for their artistic appreciation it
is not without importance to remember this.</p>

<p>Of all the Fontainebleau painters Corot was the least a realist: he was
the least bound to the earth, and he was never bent upon any exact rendering
of a part of nature. No doubt he worked much in the open air, but he worked
far more in his studio; he painted many scenes as they lay before him, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>325</span>
more often those which he only saw in his own mind. He is reported to have
said on his deathbed: &ldquo;Last night I saw in a dream a landscape with a
sky all rosy. It was charming, and still stands before me quite distinctly;
it will be marvellous to paint.&rdquo; How many landscapes may he not have
thus dreamed, and painted from the recollected vision!</p>

<p>For a young man this would be a very dangerous method. For Corot it
was the only one which allowed him to remain Corot, because in this way no
unnecessary detail disturbed the pure, poetic reverie. He had spent his
whole life in a dallying courtship with nature, ever renewed. As a child he
looked down from his attic window upon the wavering mists of the Seine;
as a schoolboy in Rouen he wandered lost in his own fancies along the borders
of the great river; when he had grown older he went every year with his
sister to a little country-house in Ville d&rsquo;Avray, which his father had bought
for him in 1817. Here he stood at the open window, in the depth of the
night, when every one was asleep, absorbed in looking at the sky and listening
to the plash of waters and the rustling of leaves. Here he stayed quite alone.
No sound disturbed his reveries, and unconsciously he drank in the soft,
moist air and the delicate vapour rising from the neighbouring river. Everything
was harmoniously reflected in his quick and eager spirit, and his eyes
beheld the individual trait of nature floating in the universal life. He
began not merely to see nature, but to feel her presence, like that of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id="page326"></a>326</span>
beloved woman, to receive her very breath and to hear the beating of her
heart.</p>

<p>One knows the marvellous letter in which he describes the day of a landscape
painter to Jules Dupré: &ldquo;<i>On se lève de bonne heure, à trois heures du
matin, avant le soleil; on va s&rsquo;asseoir au pied d&rsquo;un arbre, on regarde et on attend.
On ne voit pas grand&rsquo;chose d&rsquo;abord. La nature ressemble à une toile blanchâtre
où s&rsquo;esquissent à peine les profils de quelques masses: tout est embaumé, tout
frisonne au souffle fraîchi de l&rsquo;aube. Bing! le soleil s&rsquo;éclaircit ... le soleil
n&rsquo;a pas encore déchiré la gaze derrière laquelle se cachent la prairie, le vallon,
les collines de l&rsquo;horizon.... Les vapeurs nocturnes rampent encore commes
des flocons argentés sur les herbes d&rsquo;un vert transi. Bing!... Bing!...
un premier rayon de soleil ... un second rayon de soleil.... Les
petites fleurettes semblent s&rsquo;éveiller joyeuses.... Elles out toutes leur goutte
de rosée qui tremble ... les feuilles frileuses s&rsquo;agitent au souffle du matin ...
dans la feuillée, les oiseaux invisibles chantent.... Il semble que ce sont les
fleurs qui font la prière. Les Amours à ailes de papillons s&rsquo;ébattent sur la
prairie et font onduler les hautes herbes.... On ne voit rien ... tout y est.
Le paysage est tout entier derrière la gaze transparente du brouillard, qui, au
reste ... monte ... monte ... aspiré par le soleil ... et laisse, en se levant,
voir la rivière lamée d&rsquo;argent, les prés, les arbres, les maisonettes, le lointain
fuyant.... On distingue enfin tout ce que l&rsquo;on divinait d&rsquo;abord.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the end there is an ode
to evening which is perhaps
to be reckoned amongst the
most delicate pages of French
lyrics: &ldquo;<i>La nature s&rsquo;assoupit

soir soupire dans les feuilles
... la rosée emperle le velours
des gazons.... Les nymphes
fuient ... se cachent ...
et désirent être vues.... Bing!
une étoile du ciel qui pique
une tête dans l&rsquo;étang....
Charmante étoile, dont le frémissement
de l&rsquo;eau augmente
le scintillement, tu me regardes
... tu me souris en clignant
de l&rsquo;&oelig;il.... Bing! une
seconde étoile apparaît dans
l&rsquo;eau; un second &oelig;il s&rsquo;ouvre.
Soyez les bienvenues, fraîches et

<p>Any one who has never read anything about Corot except these lines
may know him through them alone. Even that little word &ldquo;Bing&rdquo; comprises
and elucidates his art by its clear, silvery resonance. The words vibrate
like the strings of a violin that have been gently touched, and they want
Mozart&rsquo;s music as an accompaniment. I do not know any one who has
described all the feminine tenderness of nature, the dishevelled leaves of the
birches, the heaving bosom of the air, the fresh virginity of morning, the
weary, sensuous charm of evening, with such seductive tenderness and such
highly strung feeling, so voluptuously and yet so coyly.</p>

<p>To these impressions of Rouen, Ville d&rsquo;Avray, and Barbizon were added
finally those of Paris. For Corot was born in Paris, and, often as he left it, he
always came back; he passed the greatest part of his life there, and there it
was, perhaps, that in his last period he created his most poetic works. In
these years he had no more need of actual landscapes; he needed only a sky
and they rose before him. Every evening after sundown he left his studio
just at the time when the dusk fell veiling everything. He raised his eyes
to the sky, the only part of nature which remained visible. And how often
does this twilight sky of Paris recur in Corot&rsquo;s pictures! At the end of his
life he could really give himself over to a dream. The drawings and countless
studies of his youth bear witness to the care, patience, and exactitude of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>328</span>
preparation. They gave him in after-years, when he was sure of his hand,
the right to simplify, because he knew everything thoroughly. Thus Boecklin
paints his pictures without a model, and thus Corot painted his landscapes.
The hardest problems are solved apparently as if he were improvising; and
for that very reason the sight of a Corot gives such unspeakable pleasure,
such an impression of charming ease. It is only a hand which has used a
brush for forty years that can paint thus. All effects are attained with the
minimum expenditure of strength and material. The drawing lies as if
behind colour that has been blown on to the canvas; it is as if one looked
through a thin gauze into the distance. Whoever has studied reality so
many years, with patient and observant eye, as Corot did, whoever has daily
satiated his imagination with the impressions of nature, may finally venture
on painting, not this or that scenery, but the fragrance, the very essence of
things, and render merely his own spirit and his own visions free from all
earthly and retarding accessories. There is a temptation to do honour to
Corot&rsquo;s pictures merely as &ldquo;the confessions of a beautiful soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Corot was as great and strong as a Hercules. In his blue blouse,
with his woollen cap and the inevitable short Corot pipe in his mouth&mdash;a pipe
which has become historical&mdash;one would have taken him for a carter rather
than a celebrated painter. At the same time he remained during his whole
life&mdash;a girl: twenty years senior to all the great landscape painters of the
epoch, he was at once a patriarch in their eyes and their younger comrade.
His long white hair surrounded the innocent face of a ruddy country girl,
and his kind and pleasant eyes were those of a child listening to a fairy-tale.
In 1848, during the fighting on the barricades, he asked with childish astonishment:
&ldquo;What is the matter? Are we not satisfied with the Government?&rdquo;
And during the war in 1870 this great hoary-headed child of seventy-four
bought a musket, to join in fighting against
Germany. Benevolence was the joy of his
old age. Every friend who begged for a
picture was given one, while for money he
had the indifference of a hermit who has no
wants and neither sows nor reaps, but is fed
by his Heavenly Father. He ran breathlessly
after an acquaintance to whom, contrary to
his wont, he had refused five thousand francs:
&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I am a miser, but
there they are.&rdquo; And when a picture-dealer
brought him ten thousand francs he gave him
the following direction: &ldquo;Send them,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;to the widow of my friend Millet; only, she
must believe that you have bought pictures
from <i>him</i>.&rdquo; His one passion was music, his
whole life &ldquo;an eternal song.&rdquo; Corot was a
happy man, and no one
more deserved to be happy.
In his kind-hearted vivacity
and even good spirits he
was a favourite with all
who came near him and
called him familiarly their
Papa Corot. Everything in
him was healthy and natural;
his was a harmonious
nature, living and working
happily. This harmony is
reflected in his art. And he
saw the joy in nature which
he had in himself.</p>

<p>Everything that was
coarse or horrible in nature
he avoided, and his own life
passed without romance or
any terrible catastrophes.
He has no picture in which
there is a harassed tree
vexed by the storm. Corot&rsquo;s
own spirit was touched
neither by passions nor by
the strokes of fate. There
is air in his landscapes, but never storm; streams, but not torrents; waters,
but not floods; plains, but not rugged mountains. All is soft and quiet as
his own heart, whose peace the storm never troubled.</p>

<p>No man ever lived a more orderly, regular, and reasonable life. He was
only spendthrift where others were concerned. No evening passed that he
did not play a rubber of whist with his mother, who died only a little before
him, and was loved by the old man with the devoted tenderness of a child.
From an early age he had the confirmed habits which make the day long and
prevent waste of time. The eight years which he passed in the linen-drapery
establishment of M. Delalain had accustomed him to punctuality. Every
morning he rose very early, and at three minutes to eight he was in his studio
as punctually as he had been in earlier years at the counter, and went through
his daily task without feverish haste or idleness, humming with that quietude
which makes the furthest progress.</p>

<p>For that reason he had also an aversion to everything passionate in nature,
to everything irregular, sudden, or languid, to the feverish burst of storm as
to the relaxing languor of summer heat. He loved all that is quiet, symmetrical,
and fresh, peaceful and blithe, everything that is enchanting by its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>332</span>
repose: the bright, tender sky, the woods and meadows tinged with green,
the streamlets and the hills, the regular awakening of spring, the soft, quiet
hours of evening twilight, the dewy laughing morning, the delicate mists
which form slowly the over surface of still waters, the joy of clear, starry
nights, when all voices are silent and every breeze is at rest; and the cheerfulness
of his own spirit is reflected in everything.</p>

<p>One might go further, and say that Corot&rsquo;s goodness is mirrored in his
pictures. Corot loved humanity and wished it well, and he shrank from no
sacrifice in helping his friends. And even so did he love the country, and
wished to see it animated, enlivened, and blest by human beings. That is
the great distinction between him and Chintreuil, who is otherwise so like
him. Chintreuil also painted nature when she quivers smiling beneath the
gentle and vivifying glance of spring, but figures are wanting in his pictures.
As a timid, fretful, unsociable man, he imagined that nature also felt happiest
in solitude. The scenery in which Chintreuil delighted was thick, impenetrable
copse, lonely haunts in the tangle of the thicket, from which now and
then a startled hind stretches out its head, glancing uneasily. Corot, who
could not endure solitude, being always the centre of a cheery social gathering,
made nature a sociable being. Men, women, and children give animation
to his woods and meadows. And at times he introduces peasants at work in
the fields, but how little do they resemble the peasants of Millet! The rustics
of the master of Gruchy are as hard and rough as they are actual; the burden
of life has bowed their figures and lined their faces prematurely; they are
old before their time, and weary every
evening. Corot&rsquo;s labourers never grow
weary: lightly touched in rather than
painted, dreamt of rather than seen,
they carry on an ethereal existence in
the open air, free and contented; they
have never suffered, just as Corot
himself knew no sufferings. But as a
rule human beings were altogether
out of place in the happy fields conjured
up by his fairy fantasy; and
then came the moment when Prudhon
lived again. The nymphs and bacchantes
whom he had met as a youth
by the tomb of Virgil visited him in
the evening of life in the forest of
Fontainebleau and in the meadows of
Ville d&rsquo;Avray.</p>

<p>In his pictures he dreamed of
pillars and altars near which mythical
figures moved once more, dryads
sleeping by the stream, dancing
fauns, <i>junctæque nymphis gratiæ
decentes</i> in classical raiment. In
this sense he was a Classicist all his
life. His nymphs, however, are no
mere accessories; they have nothing
in common with the faded troop of
classic beings whose old age in the
ruins of forsaken temples was so
long tended by the Academy. In
Corot they are the natural habitants
of a world of harmony and light, the
logical complement of his visions of
nature: in the same way Beethoven
at the close of the Ninth Symphony
introduced the human voice. No
sooner has he touched in the lines of
his landscapes than the nymphs and
tritons, the radiant children of the
Greek idyllic poets, desert the faded
leaves of books to populate Corot&rsquo;s
groves, and refresh themselves in the
evening shadows of his forests.</p>

<p>For the evening dusk, the hour after sunset, is peculiarly the hour of
Corot; his very preference for the harmonious beauty of dying light was
the effluence of his own harmonious temperament. When he would,
Corot was a colourist of the first order. The World Exhibition of 1889
contained pictures of women by his hand which resembled Feuerbach
in their strict and austere beauty of countenance, and which recalled
Delacroix in the liquid fulness of tone and their fantastic and variously
coloured garb. But, compared with the orgies of colour indulged in by
Romanticism, his works are generally characterised by the most delicate
reserve in painting. A bright silvery sheet of water and the ivory skin
of a nymph are usually the only touches of colour that hover in the pearly
grey mist of his pictures. As a man Corot avoided all dramas and
strong contrasts; everything abrupt or loud was repellent to his nature.
Thus it was that the painter, too, preferred the clear grey hours of
evening, in which nature envelops herself as if in a delicate, melting veil of
gauze. Here he was able to be entirely Corot, and to paint without contours
and almost without colours, and bathe in the soft, dusky atmosphere. He
saw lines no longer; everything was breath, fragrance, vibration, and mystery.
&ldquo;<i>Ce n&rsquo;est plus une toile et ce n&rsquo;est plus un peintre, c&rsquo;est le bon Dieu et c&rsquo;est le
soir.</i>&rdquo; Elysian airs began to breathe, and the faint echo of the prattling
streamlet sounded gently murmuring in the wood; the soft arms of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id="page336"></a>336</span>
nymphs clung round him, and from the neighbouring thicket tender, melting
melodies chimed forth like Æolian harps&mdash;</p>

<p>His end was as harmonious as his life and his art. &ldquo;<i>Rien ne trouble sa
fin, c&rsquo;est le soir d&rsquo;un beau jour.</i>&rdquo; His sister, with whom the old bachelor had
lived, died in the October of 1874, and Corot could not endure loneliness.
On 23rd February 1875&mdash;when he had just completed his seventy-ninth year&mdash;he
was heard to say as he lay in bed drawing with his fingers in the air:
&ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu</i>, how beautiful that is; the most beautiful landscape I have
ever seen.&rdquo; When his old housekeeper wanted to bring him his breakfast he
said with a smile: &ldquo;To-day Père Corot will breakfast above.&rdquo; Even his
last illness robbed him of none of his cheerfulness, and when his friends
brought him as he lay dying the medal struck to commemorate his jubilee
as an artist of fifty years&rsquo; standing, he said with tears of joy in his eyes: &ldquo;It
makes one happy to know that one has been so loved; I have had good
parents and dear friends. I am thankful to God.&rdquo; With those words he
passed away to his true home, the land of spirits&mdash;not the paradise of
the Church, but the Elysian fields he had dreamt of and painted so often:
&ldquo;<i>Largior hic campos æther et lumine vestit purpureo.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they bore him from his house
in the Faubour-Poissonière and a
passer-by asked who was being buried,
a fat shopwoman standing at the door
of her house answered: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
his name, but he was a good man.&rdquo;
Beethoven&rsquo;s Symphony in C minor was
played at his funeral, according to his
own direction, and as the coffin was
being lowered a lark rose exulting to
the sky. &ldquo;The artist will be replaced
with difficulty, the man never,&rdquo; said
Dupré at Corot&rsquo;s grave. On 27th May
1880 an unobtrusive monument to his
memory was unveiled at the border of
the lake at Ville d&rsquo;Avray, in the midst
of the dark forest where he had so
often dreamed. He died in the fulness
of his fame as an artist, but it was the
forty pictures collected in the Centenary
Exhibition of 1889 which first made the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page337" id="page337"></a>337</span>
world fully conscious of what modern art possessed in Corot: a master of
immortal masterpieces, the greatest poet and the tenderest soul of the
nineteenth century, as Fra Angelico was the tenderest soul of the fifteenth,
and Watteau the greatest poet of the eighteenth.</p>

<p><i>Jules Dupré</i>, a melancholy spirit, who was inwardly consumed by a lonely
existence spent in passionate work, stands as the Beethoven of modern painting
beside Corot, its Mozart. If Théodore Rousseau was the epic poet of
the Fontainebleau school, and Corot the idyllic poet, Dupré seems its tragic
dramatist. Rousseau&rsquo;s nature is hard, rude, and indifferent to man. For
Corot God is the great philanthropist, who wishes to see men happy, and
lets the spring come and the warm winds blow only that children may have
their pleasure in them. His soul is, as Goethe has it in <i>Werther</i>, &ldquo;as blithe as
those of sweet spring mornings.&rdquo; Jules Dupré has neither Rousseau&rsquo;s reality
nor Corot&rsquo;s tenderness; his tones are neither imperturbable nor subdued.
&ldquo;<i>Quant derrière un tronc d&rsquo;arbre ou derrière une pierre, vous ne trouvez pas un
homme à quoi ça sert-il de faire du paysage.</i>&rdquo; In Corot there is a charm as
of the light melodies of the <i>Zauberflöte</i>; in Dupré the ear is struck by the
shattering notes of the <i>Sinfonie Eroica</i>. Rousseau looks into the heart of
nature with widely dilated pupils and a critical glance. Corot woos her
smiling, caressing, and dallying; Dupré courts her uttering impassioned
complaint and with tears in his eyes. In him are heard the mighty fugues
of Romanticism. The trees live, the waves laugh and weep, the sky sings
and wails, and the sun, like a great conductor, determines the harmony of
the concert. Even the two pictures with which he made an appearance in
the Salon in 1835, after he had left the Sèvres china manufactory and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id="page338"></a>338</span>
become acquainted with Constable during a visit to England&mdash;the &ldquo;Near
Southampton&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pasture-land in the Limousin&rdquo;&mdash;displayed him as
an accomplished master. In &ldquo;Near Southampton&rdquo; everything moves
and moans. Across an undulating country a dark tempest blusters, like
a wild host, hurrying and sweeping forward in the gloom, tearing and scattering
everything in its path, whirling leaves from the slender trees. Clouds
big with rain hasten across the horizon as if on a forced march. The
whole landscape seems to partake in the flight; the brushwood seems to bow
its head like a traveller. In the background a few figures are recognisable:
people overtaken by the storm at their work; horses with their manes flying
in the wind; and a rider seeking refuge for himself and his beast. A stretch
of sluggish water ruffles its waves as though it were frowning. Everything
is alive and quaking in this majestic solitude, and in the mingled play of
confused lights, hurrying clouds, fluttering branches, and trembling grass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pasture-land in the Limousin&rdquo; had the same overpowering energy; it
was an admirable picture in 1835, and it is admirable still. The fine old
trees stand like huge pillars; the grass, drenched with rain, is of an intense
green; nature seems to shudder as if in a fever. And through his whole life
Dupré was possessed by the lyrical fever of Romanticism. As the last
champion of Romanticism he bore the banner of the proud generation of
1830 through well-nigh two generations, and until his death in 1889 stood
on the ground where Paul Huet had first placed French landscape; but Huet
attained his pictorial effects by combining and by calculation, while Dupré
is always a great, true, and convincing poet. Every evening he was seen in
L&rsquo;Isle Adam, where he settled in 1849, wandering alone across the fields,
even in drenching rain. One of his pupils declares that once, when they
stood at night on the bridge of the Oise during a storm, Dupré broke into
a paroxysm of tears at the magnificent spectacle. He was a fanatic rejoicing
in storms, one who watched the tragedies of the heaven with quivering emotion,
a passionate spirit consumed by his inward force, and, like his literary counterpart
Victor Hugo, he sought beauty of landscape only where it was wild and
magnificent. He is the painter of nature vexed and harassed, and of the
majestic silence that follows the storm. The theme of his pictures is at one
time the whirling torture of the yellow leaves driven before the wind in eddying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>340</span>
confusion; tormented and quivering they cleave to the furrows in the mad
chase, fall into dykes, and cling against the trunks of trees, to find refuge
from their persecutor. At another time he paints how the night wind whistles
round an old church and whirls the screaming weather-cock round and round,
how it moans and rattles with invisible hand against the doors, forces its
way through the windows, and, once shut in its stony prison, seeks a way out
again, howling and wailing. He paints sea-pieces in which the sea rages and
mutters like some hoarse old monster; the colour of the water is dirty and
pallid; the howling multitude of waves storms on like an innumerable army
before which every human power gives way. Stones are torn loose and
hurled crashing upon the shore. The clouds are dull and ghostly, here black
as smoke, there of a shining whiteness, and swollen as though they must
burst. He celebrates the commotion of the sky, nature in her angry majesty,
and the most brilliant phenomena of atmospheric life. Rousseau&rsquo;s highest
aim was to avoid painting for effect, and Corot only cared for grace of tone;
a picture of his consists &ldquo;of a little grey and a certain <i>je ne sais quoi</i>.&rdquo; Jules
Dupré is peculiarly the colour-poet of the group, and sounds the most resonant
notes in the romantic concert. His light does not beam in gently vibrating
silver tones, but is concentrated in glaring red suns. &ldquo;<i>Ah, la lumière, la
lumière!</i>&rdquo; Beside the flaming hues of evening red he paints the darkest
shadows. He revels in contrasts. His favourite key of colour is that of a
ghostly sunset, against which a gnarled oak or the dark sail of a tiny vessel
rises like a phantom.</p>

<p>Trembling and yet with ardent desire he looks at the tumult of waters,
and hears the roll and resonance of the moon-silvered tide. He delights in
night, rain, and storm. Corot&rsquo;s gentle rivulets become a rolling and whirling
flood in his pictures, a headlong stream carrying all before it. The wind no
longer sighs, but blusters across the valley, spreading ruin in its path. The
clouds which in Corot are silvery and gentle, like white lambs, are in Dupré
black and threatening, like demons of hell. In Corot the soft morning breeze
faintly agitates the tender clouds in the sky; in Dupré a damp, cold wind
of evening blows a spectral grey mist into the valley, and the hurricane tears
apart the thunderclouds.</p>

<p>The first of the brilliant pleiad who did not come from Paris itself is <i>Diaz</i>,
who in his youth worked with Dupré in the china manufactory of Sèvres. Of
noble Spanish origin&mdash;Narciso Virgilio Diaz de la Peña ran his high-sounding
name in full&mdash;he was born in Bordeaux in 1807, after his parents had taken
refuge from the Revolution
across the Pyrenees, and in his
landscapes, too, perhaps, his
Spanish blood betrays him now
and then. Diaz has in him a
little of Fortuny. Beside the
great genius wrestling for truth
and the virile seriousness of
Rousseau, beside the gloomy,
powerful landscapes of Dupré
with their deep, impassioned
poetry, the sparkling and flattering
pictures of Diaz seem to
be rather light wares. For him
nature is a keyboard on which
to play capricious fantasies.
His pictures have the effect of
sparkling diamonds, and one
must surrender one&rsquo;s self to
this charm without asking its
cause; otherwise it evaporates.
Diaz has perhaps rather
too much of the talent of a
juggler, the sparkle of a magic
kaleidoscope. &ldquo;You paint
stinging nettles, and I prefer
roses,&rdquo; is the characteristic expression
which he used to Millet.
His painting is piquant and as
iridescent as a peacock&rsquo;s tail, but in this very iridescence there is often an
unspeakable charm. It has the rocket-like brilliancy and the glancing
chivalry which were part of the man himself, and made him the best of good
company, the <i>enfant terrible</i>, the centre of all that was witty and spirited in
the circle of Fontainebleau.</p>

<p>He, too, was long acquainted with poverty, as were his great brother-artists
Rousseau and Dupré. Shortly after his birth he lost his father.
Madame Diaz, left entirely without means, came to Paris, where she supported
herself by giving lessons in Spanish and Italian. When he was ten years old
the boy was left an orphan alone in the vast city. A Protestant clergyman in
Bellevue then adopted him. And now occurred the misfortune which he
was so fond of relating in after-years. In one of his wanderings through
the wood he was bitten by a poisonous insect, and from that time he was
obliged to hobble through life with a wooden leg, which he called his <i>pilon</i>.
From his fifteenth year he worked, at first as a lame errand boy, and afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id="page344"></a>344</span>
as a painter on china, together with Dupré, Raffet, and Cabat, in the
manufactory of Sèvres. Before long he was dismissed as incompetent, for
one day he took it into his head to decorate a vase entirely after his own
taste. Then poverty began once more. Often when the evening drew on
he wandered about the boulevards under cover of the darkness, opened the
doors of carriages which had drawn up at the pavement, and stretched
out his hand to beg. &ldquo;What does it matter?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;one day I shall
have carriages and horses, and a golden crutch; my brush will win them
for me.&rdquo; He exhibited a picture on speculation at a picture-dealer&rsquo;s, in the
hope of making a hundred francs; it was &ldquo;The Descent of the Bohemians,&rdquo;
that picturesque band of men, women, and children, who advance singing,
laughing, and shouting by a steep woodland road, to descend on some neighbouring
village like a swarm of locusts. A Parisian collector bought it for
fifteen hundred francs. Diaz was saved, and he migrated to the forest of
Fontainebleau.</p>

<p>His biography explains a great deal in the character of the painter&rsquo;s art.
His works are unequal. In his picture &ldquo;Last Tears,&rdquo; which appeared in the
World Exhibition of 1855, and which stands to his landscapes as a huge block
of copper to little ingots of gold, he entered upon a course in which he wandered
long without any particular artistic result. He wanted to be a figure-painter,
and with this object he concocted a style of painting by a mixture of various
traditions, seeking to unite Prudhon, Correggio, and Leonardo. From the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page345" id="page345"></a>345</span>
master of Cluny he borrowed the feminine type with a snub nose and long
almond-shaped eyes, treated the hair like da Vinci, and placed over it the
<i>sfumato</i> of Allegri. His drawing, usually so pictorial in its light sweep, became
weak in his effort to be correct, and his colouring grew dull and monotonous
by its imitation of the style of the Classicists. But during this
period Diaz made a great deal of money, sold his pictures without intermission,
and avenged himself, as he had determined to do, upon his former poverty.
He, who had begged upon the boulevards, was able to buy weapons and
costumes at the highest figure, and build himself a charming house in the
Place Pigalle. In all that concerns his artistic position these works, which
brought him an income of fifty thousand francs, and, for a long time, the
fame of a new Prudhon, are nevertheless without importance. Faltering
between the widely divergent influences of the old masters, he did not get
beyond a wavering eclecticism, and was too weak in drawing to attain results
worth mentioning. It is as a landscape painter that he will be known to
posterity. He is said to have been the terror of all game as long as he was
the house-mate of Rousseau and Millet in Fontainebleau, and wandered
through the woods there with a gun on his arm to get a cheap supper. It
is reported, too, that when his pictures were rejected by the Salon in those
days he laughingly made a hole in the canvas with his wooden leg, saying:
&ldquo;What is the use of being rich? I can&rsquo;t have a diamond set in my <i>pilon</i>!&rdquo;
It was however in the years before 1855, when he had nothing to do with any
picture-dealer, that the immortal
works of Diaz were executed.</p>

<p>The mention of his name conjures
up before the mind the
recesses of a wood, reddened by
autumn, a wood where the sunbeams
play, gilding the trunks
of the trees; naked white forms
repose amid mysterious lights, or
on paths of golden sand appear
gaily draped odalisques, their rich
costume glittering in the rays of
the sun. Few have won from
the forest, as he did, its beauty
of golden sunlight and verdant
leaves. Others remained at the
entrance of the forest; he was
the first who really penetrated to
its depths. The branches met over
his head like the waves of the
sea, the blue heaven vanished,
and everything was shrouded.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page346" id="page346"></a>346</span>
The sunbeams fell like the rain of Danaë through the green leaves, and the
moss lay like a velvet mantle on the granite piles of rock. He settled down
like a hermit in his verdant hollow. The leaves quivered green and red, and
covered the ground, shining like gold in the furtive rays of the evening sun.
Nothing was to be seen of the trees, nothing of the outline of their foliage,
nothing of the majestic sweep of their boughs, but only the mossy stems
touched by the radiance of the sun. The pictures of Diaz are not landscapes,
for the land is wanting; they are &ldquo;tree scapes,&rdquo; and their poetry lies
in the sunbeams which dance playing round them. &ldquo;Have you seen my last
stem?&rdquo; he would himself inquire of the visitors to his studio.</p>

<p>These woodland recesses were the peculiar specialty of Diaz, and he but
seldom abandoned them to paint warm, dreamy pictures of summer. For,
like a true child of the South, he only cared to see nature on beautiful days.
He knows nothing of spring with its light mist, and still less of the frozen
desolation of winter. The summer alone does he know, the summer and the
autumn; and the summers of Diaz are an everlasting song, like the springs
of Corot. Beautiful nymphs and other beings from the golden age give
animation to his emerald meadows and his sheltered woods bathed in the
sun: here are little, homely-looking nixies, and there are pretty Cupids and
Venuses and Dianas of charming grace. And none of these divinities think
about anything or do anything; they are not piquant, like those of Boucher
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page347" id="page347"></a>347</span>
and Fragonard, and they know neither coquetry nor smiles. They are merely
goddesses of the palette; their wish is to be nothing but shining spots of
colour, and they love nothing except the silvery sunbeams which fall caressingly
on their naked skin. If the painter wishes for more vivid colour they
throw around them shining red, blue, yellowish-green, or gold-embroidered
clothes, and immediately are transformed from nymphs into Oriental women,
as in a magic theatre. A fragment of soft silk, gleaming with gold, and a red
turban were means sufficient for him to conjure up his charming and fanciful
land of Turks. Sometimes even simple mortals&mdash;wood-cutters, peasant girls,
and gipsies&mdash;come into his pictures, that the sunbeams may play upon them,
while their picturesque rags form piquant spots of colour.</p>

<p>Diaz belongs to the same category as Isabey and Fromentin, a fascinating
artist, a great <i>charmeur</i>, and a feast to the eyes.</p>

<p>When in the far South, amid the eternal summer of Mentone, he closed
his dark, shining eyes for ever, at dawn on 18th November 1876, a breath of
sadness went through the tree-tops of the old royal forest of Fontainebleau.
The forest had lost its hermit, the busy woodsman who penetrated farthest
into its green depths; and it preserves his memory gratefully. Only go, in
October, through the copse of Bas Bréau, lose yourself amid the magnificent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page348" id="page348"></a>348</span>
foliage of these century-old trees that glimmer with a thousand hues like
gigantic bouquets, dark green and brown, or golden and purple, and at the
sight of this brilliant gleam of autumn tones you can only say, A Diaz!</p>

<p>The youngest of the group, <i>Daubigny</i>, came when the battle was over, and
plays a slighter <i>rôle</i>, since he cannot be reckoned any longer among the
discoverers; nevertheless he has a physiognomy of his own, and one of peculiar
charm. The others were painters of nature; Daubigny is the painter of the
country. If one goes from Munich to Dachau to see the apple trees blossom
and the birches growing green, to breathe in the odour of the cow-house and
the fragrance of the hay, to hear the tinkle of cow-bells, the croaking of frogs,
and the hum of gnats, one does not say, &ldquo;I want to see nature,&rdquo; but &ldquo;I am
going into the country.&rdquo; Jean Jacques Rousseau was the worshipper of
nature, while Georges Sand, in certain of her novels, has celebrated country
life. In this sense Daubigny is less an adorer of nature than a man fond of
the country. His pictures give the feeling one has in standing at the window
on a country excursion, and looking at the laughing and budding spring.
One feels no veneration for the artist, but one would like to be a bird to
perch on those boughs, a lizard to creep amongst this green, a cockchafer to
fly humming from tree to tree.</p>

<p>Daubigny, possibly, has not the great and free creative power of the
older artists, their magnificent simplicity in treating objects: the feminine
element, the susceptibility to natural beauty, preponderates in him, and not
the virile, creative power of embodiment, which at once discovers in itself a
telling force of expression for the image received from nature. He seeks
after no poetic emotions, like Dupré; he has not the profound, penetrative
eye for nature, like Rousseau; in his charm and amiability he approaches
Corot, except that mythological beings are no longer at home in his landscapes.
They would take no pleasure in this odour of damp grass, the smell
of the cow-byres, and the dilapidated old skiffs which rock, in Daubigny&rsquo;s
pictures, fastened to a swampy bank. Corot, light, delicate, and simple
as a boy, sitting on a school-bench all his life, is always veiled and mysterious.
Daubigny, heavier and technically better equipped, has more power and less
grace; he dreams less and paints more. Corot made the apotheosis of nature:
his silvery grey clouds bore him to the Elysian fields, where nothing had the
heaviness of earth and everything melted in poetic vapour. Daubigny,
borne by no wings of Icarus, seems like Antæus beside him; he is bodily
wedded to the earth. Dupré made the earth a mirror of the tears and passions
of men. Corot surprised her before the peasant is up of a morning, in the
hours when she belongs altogether to the nymphs and the fairies. In Daubigny
the earth has once more become the possession of human beings. It is not
often that figures move in his pictures. Even Rousseau more often finds a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page350" id="page350"></a>350</span>
place in his landscapes for the rustic, but nature in him is hard, unapproachable,
and deliberately indifferent to man. She looks down upon him austerely,
closing and hardening her heart against him. In Daubigny nature is familiar
with man, stands near him, and is kindly and serviceable. The skiffs rocking
at the river&rsquo;s brink betray that fishers are in the neighbourhood; even when
they are empty his little houses suggest that their inhabitants are not far off,
that they are but at work in the field and may come back at any moment. In
Rousseau man is merely an atom of the infinite; here he is the lord of creation.
Rousseau makes an effect which is simple and powerful, Dupré one which is
impassioned and striking, Corot is divine, Diaz charming, and Daubigny
idyllic, intimate, and familiar. He closed a period and enjoyed the fruits of
what the others had called into being. One does not admire him&mdash;one loves
him.</p>

<p>He had passed his youth with his nurse in a little village, surrounded with
white-blossoming apple trees and waving fields of corn, near L&rsquo;Isle Adam.
Here as a boy he received the impressions which made him a painter of the
country, and which were too strong to be obliterated by a sojourn in Italy.
The best picture that he painted there showed a flat stretch of land with
thistles. A view of the island of St. Louis was the work with which he first
appeared in the Salon in 1838.</p>

<p>Daubigny is the painter of water, murmuring silver-grey between ashes
and oaks, and reflecting the clouds of heaven in its clear mirror. He is the
painter of the spring in its fragrance, when the meadows shine in the earliest
verdure, and the leaves but newly unfolded stand out against the sky as
bright green patches of colour, when the limes blossom and the crops begin
to shoot. A field of green corn waving gently beneath budding apple trees
in the breeze of spring, still rivers in which banks and bushy islands are
reflected, mills beside little streams rippling in silvery clearness over shining
white pebbles, cackling geese, and washerwomen neatly spreading out their
linen, are things which Daubigny has painted with the delicate feeling of a
most impressionable lover of nature. At the same time he had the secret of
shedding over his pictures the most marvellous tint of delicate, vaporous
air; especially in those representations, at once so poetic and so accurate,
of evening by the water&rsquo;s edge, or of bright moonlight nights, when all things
are sharply illuminated, and yet softly shrouded with a dream-like exhalation.
His favourite light was that of cool evening dusk, after the sun and every
trace of the after-glow has vanished from the sky. Valmandois, where he
passed his youth, and afterwards the Oise, with its green banks and vineyards
and hedged gardens, the most charming and picturesque river in North
France, are most frequently rendered in his pictures. Every day, when
nature put on her spring garb, he sailed along the banks in a small craft,
with his son Charles. His most vigorous works were executed in the cabin
of this vessel: spirited sketches of regions delicately veiled in mist and bound
with a magical charm of peace, regions with the moon above them, shedding
its clear, silver light&mdash;refined etchings which assure him a place of honour
in the history of modern etching. The painter of the banks of the Oise saw
everything with the curiosity and the love of a child, and remained always
a naïve artist in spite of all his dexterity.</p>

<p>After these great masters had opened up the path a tribe of landscape
painters set themselves to render, each in his own way, the vigorous power,
the tender charm, and the plaintive melancholy of the earth. Some loved
dusk and light, the simple reproduction of ordinary places in their ordinary
condition; others delighted in the struggle of the elements, the violent
scudding of clouds, the parting glance of the sun, the sombre hours when
nature shrouds her face with the mourning veil of a widow.</p>

<p>Although he never tasted the pleasures of fame, <i>Antoine Chintreuil</i> was
the most refined of them all&mdash;an excessively sensitive spirit, who seized with
as much delicacy as daring swiftly transient effects of nature, such as seldom
appear: the moment when the sun casts a fleeting radiance in the midst of
clouds, or when a shaft of light quivers for an instant through a dense mist;
the effect of green fields touched by the first soft beams of the sun, or that
of a rainbow spanning a fresh spring landscape. His pupil <i>Jean Desbrosses</i>
was the painter of hills and valleys. <i>Achard</i> followed Rousseau in his pictures
of lonely, austere, and mournful regions. <i>Français</i> painted familiar corners
in the neighbourhood of Paris with grace, although more heavily than Corot,
and without the shining light which is poured through the works of that rare
genius. The pictures of <i>Harpignies</i> are rather dry, and betray a heavy
hand. He is rougher than his great predecessors, less seductive and indeed
rather staid, but he has a convincing reality, and is loyal and simple. He is
valuable as an honest, genial artist, a many-sided and sure-footed man of
talent, somewhat inclined to Classicism. <i>Émile Breton</i>, the brother of Jules,
delighted in the agitation of the elements, wild, out-of-the-way regions, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page354" id="page354"></a>354</span>
harsh climate. His execution is broad, his tones forcible, and he has both
simplicity and largeness. Apart from his big, gloomy landscapes, <i>Léonce
Chabry</i> has also painted sea-pieces, with dark waves dashing against the
cleft rocks.</p>

<p>The representation of grazing animals plays a great part in the art of
almost all of these painters. Some carried the love of animal painting so far
that they never painted a landscape without introducing into the foreground
their dearly loved herds of cows or flocks of sheep. The key of the landscape,
the cheerful and sunny brilliancy of colour or the still melancholy of the
evening dusk, is harmoniously repeated in the habits and being of these
animals. Thus, too, new paths were opened to animal painting, which had
suffered, no less than landscape, from the yoke of conventionality.</p>

<p>Up to the close of the eighteenth century French artists had contented
themselves with adapting to French taste the light and superficial art of
Nicolaus Berghem. Demarne, one of the last heirs of this Dutch artist,
brought, even in the period of the Revolution, a little sunshine, blitheness,
and country air amongst the large pictures in the classical manner. The
animal painting of the <i>ancien régime</i> expired in his arms, and the &ldquo;noble
style&rdquo; of Classicism obstructed the rise of the new animal painting. The
fact that the great Jupiter, father of gods and men, assumed the form of a
four-footed creature when he led weak, feminine beings astray had no doubt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page355" id="page355"></a>355</span>
given a certain justification to the animal picture during the reign of the school
of David. But the artists preferred to hold aloof from it, either because
animals are hard to idealise in themselves, or because the received antique
sculpture of animals was difficult to employ directly in pictures. In landscapes,
which gods and heroes alone honoured with their presence, idealised
animals would have been altogether out of place. Only animals which are
very difficult to draw correctly, such as sphinxes, sirens, and winged horses&mdash;beings
which the old tragedians were fond of turning to account&mdash;are occasionally
allowed to exist in the pictures of Bertin and Paul Flandrin. <i>Carle
Vernet</i>, who composed cavalry charges and hunting scenes, had not talent
enough seriously to make a breach, or to find disciples to follow his lead.
<i>Géricault</i>, the forerunner of Romanticism, was likewise the first eminent
painter of horses; and although his great &ldquo;Raft of the Medusa&rdquo; is heavily
fettered by the system of Classicism, his jockey pictures and horse races are
as fresh, as vivid, and as unforced as if they had been painted yesterday
instead of seventy years ago. In dashing animation, verve, and temperament
Géricault stands alone in these pictures; he is the very opposite of Raymond
Brascassat, who was the first specialist of animal pieces with a landscape
setting, and was much praised in the thirties on account of his neat and
ornamental style of treatment. <i>Brascassat</i> was the Winterhalter of animal
painting, neither Classicist nor Romanticist nor Realist, but the embodiment of
mediocrity; a man honestly and sincerely regarding all nature with the eyes
of a Philistine. His fame, which has so swiftly faded, was founded by those
patrons of art who above all demand that a picture should be the bald, banal
reproduction of fact, made with all the accuracy possible.</p>

<p>It was only when the landscape school of Fontainebleau had initiated a
new method of vision, feeling, and expression that France produced a new
great painter of animals. As Dupré and Rousseau tower over their predecessors
Cabat and Flandrin in landscape, so <i>Constant Troyon</i> rises above
Brascassat in animal painting. In the latter there may be found a scrupulous
pedantic observation in union with a thin, polished, academic, and carefully
arranged style of painting; in the former, a large and broad technique in
harmony with wild nature, and a directness and force of intuition without
parallel in the history of art. Brascassat belongs to the same category as
Denner, Troyon to that of Frans Hals and Brouwer.</p>

<p>There would be no purpose in saying anything of his labours in the china
manufactory of Sèvres, of his industrial works, and of the little classical views
with which he made a first appearance in the Salon in 1833, or of the impulse
which he received from Roqueplan. He first found his own powers when he
made the acquaintance of Théodore Rousseau and Jules Dupré, and migrated
with them into the forest of Fontainebleau. At the headquarters of the new
school his ideas underwent a revolution. Here, in the first instance, as a
landscape painter, he was attracted by the massive forms of cattle, which
make such a harmonious effect of colour in the atmosphere and against verdure,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page357" id="page357"></a>357</span>
and the philosophic quietude of which gives such admirable completion to the
dreamy spirit of nature. A journey to Holland and Belgium in 1847, in the
course of which he became more familiar with the old animal painters, confirmed
him in the resolve of devoting himself exclusively to this province.
He was captivated not so much by Paul Potter as by Albert Cuyp, with his
rich and powerful colouring, and his technique, which is at once so virile and
so easy. But above all Rembrandt became his great ideal, and filled him
with wonder. In his first masterpiece of 1849, &ldquo;The Mill,&rdquo; the influence
of the great Dutch artist is clearly recognisable, and from that time up to
1855 it remained dominant. In this year, during a prolonged sojourn in
Normandy, he became Troyon, and painted &ldquo;Oxen going to their Work,&rdquo;
that mighty picture in the Louvre which displays him in the zenith of his
creative power. Till then no animal painter had rendered with such a combination
of strength and actuality the long, heavy gait, the philosophical
indifference, and the quiet resignation of cattle, the poetry of autumnal light,
and the mist of morning rising lightly from the earth and veiling the whole
land with grey, silvery hues. The deeply furrowed smoking field makes an
undulating ascent, so that one seems to be looking at the horizon over the
broad face of the earth. A primitive, Homeric feeling rests over it.</p>

<p>Troyon is perhaps not so correct as Potter, nor so lucid as Albert Cuyp,
but he is more forcible and impressive than either. No one has ever seized
the poetry of these heavy masses of flesh, with their strong colour and largeness
of outline, as he has done. What places him far above the old painters is
his fundamental power as a landscapist, a power unequalled except in Rousseau.
His landscapes have always the smell of the earth, and they smack of rusticity.
At one time he paints the atmosphere, veiling the contours of objects with a
light mist recalling Corot, and yet saturated with clear sunshine; at another
he sends his heavy, fattened droves in the afternoon across field-paths bright
in the sunlight and dark green meadows, or places them beneath a sky where
dense thunderclouds are swiftly rolling up. Troyon is no poet, but a born
painter, belonging to the irrepressibly forceful family of Jordaens and Courbet,
a <i>maître peintre</i> of strength and plastic genius, as healthy as he is splendid
in colour. His &ldquo;Cow scratching Herself&rdquo; and his &ldquo;Return to the Farm&rdquo;
will always be counted amongst the most forcible animal pictures of all ages.</p>

<p>When he died in 1865, after passing twelve years with a clouded intellect,
<i>Rosa Bonheur</i> sought to fill the place which he had left vacant. She had
already won the sympathies of the great public, as she united in her pictures
all the qualities which were missed in Troyon, and had the art of pleasing
where he was repellent. For a long time Troyon&rsquo;s works were held by
<i>amateurs</i> to be wanting in finish. They did not acknowledge to themselves
that &ldquo;finish&rdquo; in artistic creations is, after all, only a work of patience, rather
industrial than artistic, and at bottom invented for the purpose of enticing
half-trained connoisseurs. Rosa Bonheur had this diligence, and is indebted
to it for the spread of her fame through all Europe, when Troyon was only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page358" id="page358"></a>358</span>
known as yet to the few. The position has now been altered. Without
doubt it is a pleasure to look at her fresh and sunny maiden picture of 1840,
&ldquo;Ploughing in Nivernois,&rdquo; with its yoke of six oxen, its rich red-brown soil
turned up into furrows, and its wide, bright, simple, and laughing landscape
beneath the clear blue sky. She had all the qualities which may be appreciated
without one&rsquo;s being an epicure of art&mdash;great anatomical knowledge, dexterous
technique, charming and seductive colouring. And it is an isolated fact in
the history of art that a woman has painted pictures so good as the &ldquo;Hay
Harvest in Auvergne&rdquo; of 1853, with its brutes which are almost life-size, or
the &ldquo;Horse Fair&rdquo; of 1855, which is perhaps her most brilliant work, and for
which she made studies, going in man&rsquo;s clothes for eighteen months, at all the
Parisian <i>manèges</i>, amongst stable-boys and horse-dealers. Until her death,
from the Château By, between Thomery and Fontainebleau, she carried on an
extensive transpontine export, and her pictures are by no means the worst
of those which find their way from the Continent to England and America.
She was perhaps the only feminine celebrity of the century who painted her
pictures, instead of working at them like knitting. But Troyon is a strong
master who suffers no rival. His landscapes, with their deep verdure, their
powerful animals, and their skies traversed by heavy clouds, are the embodiment
of power. Rosa Bonheur is an admirable painter with largeness of style
and beauty of drawing, whose artistic position is between Troyon and
Brascassat.</p>

<p>Troyon&rsquo;s only pupil was <i>Émile van Marcke</i>, half a Belgian, who met the
elder master in Sèvres, and for a long time worked by his side at Fontainebleau.
He united the occupation of a painter with that of a landed proprietor. The
cattle which he bred on an extensive scale at his property, Bouttencourt in
Normandy, had a celebrity amongst French landowners, as he had the reputation
of rearing the best fat cattle. He too had not the impressiveness of
Troyon, though he was, none the less, a healthy and forcible master. His
animals have no passions, no movement, and no battles. They seem lost
in endless contemplation, gravely and sedately chewing the cud. Around
them stretch the soft green Norman pastures, and above them arches the
wide sky, which at the horizon imperceptibly melts into the sea.</p>

<p><i>Jadin</i> is a painter of horses and dogs who had once a great reputation,
though to-day his name is almost, if not entirely forgotten. He was fond
of painting hunting scenes, and is not wanting in life and movement; but he
is too impersonal to play a part in the history of painting. Having named
him, some mention must likewise be made of <i>Eugène Lambert</i>, the painter of
cats, and <i>Palizzi</i>, who painted goats. Lambert, who was fond of introducing
his little heroes as the actors of comical scenes, is by admission the chief amongst
all those who were honoured amongst the different nations with the title of
&ldquo;Raphaels of the Cat.&rdquo; Palizzi, an incisive master of almost brutal energy, a
true son of the wild Abruzzo hills, delighted, like his compatriots Morelli and
Michetti, in the blazing light of noon, shining over rocky heights, and throwing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page359" id="page359"></a>359</span>
a dazzle of gold on the dark green copse. <i>Lançon</i>, a rather arid painter, though
a draughtsman with a broad and masculine stroke, was the greatest descendant
of Delacroix in the representation of tigers, lions, bears, and hippopotamuses.
An unobtrusive artist, though one of very genial talent, was <i>Charles Jacque</i>,
the Troyon of sheep. He has been compared with the <i>rageur</i> of Bas Bréau,
the proud oak which stands alone in a clearing. A man of forcible character,
over whom age had no power, he survived until 1894 as the last representative
of the noble school of Barbizon. He has painted sheep in flocks or separately,
in the pasture, on the verge of the field-path, or in the fold; and he loved most
of all to paint them in the misty hours of evening twilight, at peace and amid
peaceful nature. But in spirited etchings he has likewise represented old
weather-beaten walls, the bright films of spring, the large outlines of peasant
folk, the tender down of young chickens, the light play of the wind upon the
sea, murmuring brooks, and quiet haunts of the wood. Like Millet, he had
in an eminent degree the gift of simplification, the greatest quality that an
artist can have. With three or four strokes he could plant a figure on its
feet, give life to an animal, or construct a landscape. He was the most intimate
friend of Jean François Millet, and painted part of what Millet painted also.</p>

<p class="center chap2">JEAN FRANÇOIS MILLET</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">Whence</span> has <i>Millet</i> come?</p>

<p>It was the time when art, still blind to the life around, could find
no subjects worthy of it except in the past and in the distance. Then Millet
came and overthrew an art vegetating in museums or astray in tropical
countries. It was the time when Leopold Robert in Italy tested the noble
pose of the school of David upon the peasant, and when the German painters
of rustics recognised in the labourer an object for pleasantries and pathetic
little scenes. Then Millet stepped forward and painted, with profound
simplicity, the people at work in the field, or in their distress, without sentimentality
and without beautifying or idealising them. That great utterance,
&ldquo;I work,&rdquo; the utterance of the nineteenth century, is here spoken aloud for
the first time. Rousseau and his fellow-artists were the painters of the country.
Millet became the painter of the labourer. He, the great peasant, is the
creator of that painting of peasants which is entwined with the deepest roots
of intimate landscape. Misunderstood in the beginning, it proclaimed for
the first time the new gospel of art before which the people of all nations bow
at the present date. What others did later was merely to advance on the
path opened by Millet. And as time passes the figure of this powerful man
shines more and more brilliantly. The form of Jean François Millet rises so
powerfully, so imperiously, and so suddenly that one might almost imagine him
to have come from Ibsen&rsquo;s third kingdom; for he is without forerunners in
art. An attempt has been made to bring him into relation with the social
and political movement of ideas in the forties, but certainly this is unjust.
Millet was in no sense revolutionary. During his whole life he repudiated the
designs which some of the democratic party imputed to him, as well as the
conclusions which they drew from his works.</p>

<p>Millet&rsquo;s life in itself explains his art. Never have heart and hand, a man
and his work, tallied with each other as they did in him. He does not belong
to those painters who, even when one admires them, give one nevertheless a
sense that they could just as easily have produced something different. Let
any one consider his works and read the letters published in Sensier&rsquo;s book:
the man whom one knows from the letters lives in his works, and these works
are the natural illustration of the book in which the man has depicted himself.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page361" id="page361"></a>361</span>
In the unity of man and artist lies the source of his strength, the secret of his
greatness.</p>

<p>Even the circumstances over which he triumphed necessitated his being
the painter that he actually was, if he became one at all. He was not born in
a city where a child&rsquo;s eyes are everywhere met by works of art&mdash;pictures which
no doubt early awaken the feeling for art, but which just as easily disturb a
free outlook into nature. Moreover, he did not spring from one of those
families where art is itself practised, or where art is discussed and taste early
guided upon definite lines. He was a peasant, whose father and grandfather
were peasants before him, and whose brothers were farm labourers. He was
born in 1814, far away from Paris, in a little Norman village hard by the sea,
and there he grew up. The regular and majestic plunge of the waves against
the granite rocks of the coast, the solemn murmurs of the ebb and flow of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page362" id="page362"></a>362</span>
sea, the moaning of the wind in the apple trees and the old oaks of his father&rsquo;s
garden, were the first sounds which struck upon the ear in Gruchy, near
Cherbourg. It has been adduced that his father loved music, and had had
success as the leader of the village choir. But though there may have always
been a dim capacity for art in the youngster&rsquo;s blood, there was nothing
calculated to strengthen it in his education. Millet&rsquo;s sturdy father had no
idea of making an artist of his son; the boy saw no artist at work in the
neighbourhood; nature and instinct guided him alone.</p>

<p>For a man brought up in a city and trained at an academy all things become
hackneyed. Many centuries of artistic usage have dimmed their original
freshness; and he finds a ready-made phrase coined for everything. Millet
stood before the world like the first man in the day of creation. Everything
seemed new to him; he was charmed and astonished, and a wild flood of
impressions burst in upon him. He did not come under the influence of any
tradition, but approached art like the man in the age of stone who first
scratched the outline of a mammoth on a piece of ivory, or like the primæval
Greek who, according to the legend, invented painting by making a likeness
of his beloved with a charred stick upon a wall. No one encouraged him in
his first attempts. No one dreamt that this young man was destined to any
life other than that of a peasant. From the time he was fourteen until he
was eighteen he did every kind of field labour upon his father&rsquo;s land in the
same way as his brothers&mdash;hoeing, digging, ploughing, mowing, threshing,
sowing the seed, and dressing the ground. But he always had his eyes about
him; he drew upon a white patch of wall, without guidance, the picture of
a tree, an orchard, or a peasant whom he had chanced to meet on a Sunday
when going to church. And he drew so correctly that every one recognised
the likenesses. A family council was held upon the matter. His father
brought one of his son&rsquo;s drawings to a certain M. Mouchel in Cherbourg, a
strange personage who had once been a painter and had the reputation of
being a connoisseur; and he was to decide whether François &ldquo;had really
enough talent for painting to gain his bread by it.&rdquo; So Millet, the farm-hand,
was twenty when he received his first lessons in drawing. He was learning
the A B C of art, but humanly speaking he was already Millet. What had
roused his talent and induced him to take a stump of charcoal in his hand was
not the study of any work of art, but the sight of nature&mdash;nature, the great
mother of all, who had embraced him, nature with whom and through whom
he lived. Through her, visions and emotions were quickened in him, and he
felt the secret impulse to give them expression.</p>

<p>Of what concerned the manual part of his art he understood nothing, and
his two teachers in Cherbourg, Mouchel and Langlois, who were half-barbarians
themselves, gave him the less knowledge, as only two months later, in 1835,
his father died, and the young man returned to his own people as a farm-labourer
once more. And it was only after an interruption of three years
that a subsidy from the community of Cherbourg, which was collected by his
teacher Langlois, and a small sum saved by his parents&mdash;six hundred francs
all told&mdash;enabled him to journey up to Paris. He was twenty-three years of
age, a broad-chested Hercules in stature, for till that time he had breathed
nothing but the pure, sharp sea air; his handsome face was framed in long
fair locks, which fell wildly about his shoulders. What had this peasant to do
in the capital! In Delaroche&rsquo;s school he was called <i>l&rsquo;homme des bois</i>. He had
all the awkwardness of a provincial, and the artist was only to be surmised
from the fire in the glance of his large dark blue eyes. At first Delaroche took
peculiar pains with his new pupil. But to submit to training is to follow the
lead of another person. A man like Millet, who knew what he wanted, was no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page364" id="page364"></a>364</span>
longer to be guided upon set lines. The pictures of Delaroche made no appeal
to him. They struck him as being &ldquo;huge vignettes, theatrical effects without
any real sentiment.&rdquo; And Delaroche soon lost patience with the clumsy
peasant, whom he&mdash;most unfairly&mdash;regarded as stiff-necked and obstinate.</p>

<p>Other aims floated before Millet, and he <i>could</i> not now learn to produce
academical compositions, so, as these were alone demanded in the school of
Delaroche, he never cleared himself from a reputation for mediocrity. It was
the period of the war between the Classicists and the Romanticists. &ldquo;An
Ingres, a Delacroix!&rdquo; was the battle-cry that rang through the Parisian
studios. For Millet neither of these movements had any existence. His
memory only clung to the plains of Normandy, and the labourers, shepherds,
and fishermen of his home, with whom he mingled in spirit once more. Incessantly
he believed himself to hear what he has called &ldquo;<i>le cri de la terre</i>,&rdquo;
and neither Romanticists nor Classicists caught anything of this cry of the
earth. He lived alone with his own thoughts, associating with none of his
fellow-artists, and indeed keeping out of their way. Always prepared for
some scornful attempt at witticism, he turned his easel round whenever he
was approached, or gruffly cut all criticism short with the remark: &ldquo;What
does my painting matter to you? I don&rsquo;t trouble my head about your
bread and grease.&rdquo; Thus it was that Delaroche certainly taught him very
little of the technique of painting, though, at the same time, he taught him
no mannerism. He did not learn to paint pretty pictures with beautiful
poses, flattering colour, and faces inspired with intellect. He left the studio
as he had entered it in 1837, painting with an awkward, thick, heavy, and
laborious brush, though with the fresh, untroubled vision which he had had in
earlier days. He was still the stranger, the incorrigible Norman peasant.</p>

<p>For a time he exerted himself to make concessions to the public. At
seven-and-twenty he had married a Cherbourg girl, who died of consumption
three years afterwards. Without acquaintances in Paris, and habituated to
domestic life from his youth upwards, he married a second time in 1845. He
had to earn his bread, to please, to paint what would sell. So he toiled over
pretty pictures of nude women, like those which Diaz had painted with such
great success&mdash;fair shepherdesses and gallant herdsmen, and bathing girls,
in the <i>genre</i> of Boucher and Fragonard. And he who did this spoke of both
of them afterwards as pornographists. But the attempt was vain, for he
satisfied neither others nor himself. The peasant of Gruchy could not be
piquant, easy, and charming; on the contrary, he remained helpless, awkward,
and crude. &ldquo;Your women bathing come from the cow-house&rdquo; was the
appropriate remark of Diaz in reference to these pictures. When Burger-Thoré,
who was the first to take notice of Millet, declared, on the occasion of
&ldquo;The Milkmaid&rdquo; being exhibited in 1844, that Boucher himself was surpassed
in this picture, the critic took a literary licence, because he had a human
pity for the poor painter. How little the picture has of the fragrance of the
old masters! how laboured it seems! how obvious it is that it was painted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page365" id="page365"></a>365</span>
without pleasure!  Millet was not long at pains to conceal his personality.
An &ldquo;&OElig;dipus&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Jewish Captives in Babylon&rdquo; were his last rhetorical
exercises. In 1848 he came forward with a manifesto&mdash;&ldquo;The Winnower,&rdquo; a
peasant in movement and bearing, in his whole character and in the work on
which he is employed.  Millet returns here to the thoughts and feelings of his
youth; for the future he will paint nothing but peasants in all the situations
of their rude and simple life.  In 1849 he made a great resolve.</p>

<p>The sale of his &ldquo;Winnower&rdquo; had brought him five hundred francs, and
these five hundred francs gave him courage to defy the world. &ldquo;Better turn
bricklayer than paint against conviction.&rdquo; Charles Jacque, the painter of
animals, who lived opposite to him in the Rue Rochechouard, wanted to quit
Paris in 1849 on account of the outbreak of cholera.  He proposed that Millet
should go with him into the country for a short time; he did so, and the
peasant&rsquo;s son of former times became once more a peasant, to end his days
amongst peasants. &ldquo;In the middle of the forest of Fontainebleau,&rdquo; said
Jacque, &ldquo;there is a little nest, with a name ending in &lsquo;zon&rsquo;&mdash;not far off and
cheap,&mdash;Diaz has been telling me a great deal about it.&rdquo;  Millet consented.
One fine June day they got into a heavy, rumbling omnibus, with their wives
and their five children, and they arrived in Fontainebleau that evening after
two hours&rsquo; journey. &ldquo;To-morrow we are going in search of our &lsquo;zon.&rsquo;&rdquo;
And the next day they went forward on foot to Barbizon, Millet with his two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page366" id="page366"></a>366</span>
little girls upon his shoulders, and his wife carrying in her arms the youngest
child, a boy of five months old, having her skirt drawn over her head as a
protection against the rain.</p>

<p>As yet the forest had no walks laid out as it has to-day; it was virgin
nature, which had never been disturbed. &ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu, mon Dieu, que c&rsquo;est
beau!</i>&rdquo; cried Millet, exulting. Once more he stood in the presence of nature,
the old love of his youth. The impressions of childhood rushed over him.
Born in the country, he had to return to the country to be himself once again.
He arrived at Ganne&rsquo;s inn just as the dinner-hour had assembled twenty
persons at the table, artists with their wives and children. &ldquo;New painters!
The pipe, the pipe!&rdquo; was the cry which greeted the fresh arrivals. Diaz
rose, and, in spite of his wooden leg, did the honours of the establishment to
the two women with the dignity of a Spanish nobleman, and then turned
gravely to Millet and Jacque, saying: &ldquo;Citizens, you are invited to smoke
the pipe of peace.&rdquo; Whenever the colony of Barbizon received an addition
this was always taken down from its sacred place above the door. An
expressly appointed jury had then to decide from the ascending rings of smoke
whether the new-comer was to be reckoned amongst the &ldquo;Classicists&rdquo; or the
&ldquo;Colourists.&rdquo; Jacque was with one voice declared to be a &ldquo;Colourist.&rdquo;
As to Millet&rsquo;s relation to the schools, there was a discrepancy of opinion.
&ldquo;<i>Eh bien</i>,&rdquo; said Millet, &ldquo;<i>si vous êtes embarrassés, placez-moi dans la mienne</i>.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page367" id="page367"></a>367</span>
Whereupon Diaz, as the others would not let this pass, cried: &ldquo;Be quiet;
it is a good retort, and the fellow looks powerful enough to found a school
which will bury us all.&rdquo; He was right, even though it was late before his
prophecy was fulfilled.</p>

<p>Millet was thirty-five when he settled in Barbizon; he had reached the
age which Dante calls the middle point of life. He had no further tie with the
outward world; he had broken all the bridges behind him, and relied upon
himself. He only went back to Paris on business, and he always did so
unwillingly and for as short a time as possible. He lived at Barbizon in the
midst of nature and in the midst of his models, and to his last day unreservedly
gave himself up to the work which in youth he had felt himself called to fulfil.
Neither criticism, mockery, nor contempt could lead him any more astray;
even if he had wished it, he would have been incapable of following the paths
of official art. &ldquo;<i>Mes critiques</i>,&rdquo; said he as though by way of excuse, &ldquo;<i>sont
gens instruits et de goût, mais je ne peux me mettre dans leur peau, et comme je
n&rsquo;ai jamais vu de ma vie autre chose que les champs, je tâche de dire comme je
peux ce que j&rsquo;y ai éprouvé
quand j&rsquo;y travaillais</i>.&rdquo; When
such a man triumphs, when
he succeeds in forcing upon
the world his absolutely personal
art, it is not Mahomet
who has come to the mountain,
but the mountain to
Mahomet.</p>

<p>Millet&rsquo;s life has been, in
consequence, a continuous
series of renunciations. It is
melancholy to read in Sensier&rsquo;s
biography that such a master,
even during his Paris days,
was forced to turn out copies
at twenty francs and portraits
at five, and to paint tavern
signs or placards for the
booths of rope-dancers and
horse-dealers, each one of
which brought him in a roll
of thick sous. When the
Revolution of June broke out
his capital consisted of thirty
francs, which the owner of a
small shop had paid him for
a sign, and on this he and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page368" id="page368"></a>368</span>
his family lived for a fortnight. In Barbizon he boarded with a peasant and
lived with his family in a tiny room where wheat was stored and where bread
was baked twice in the week; then he took a little house at a hundred and
sixty francs a year. In winter he sat in a workroom without a fire, in thick
straw shoes and with an old horse-cloth over his shoulders. Living like this
he painted &ldquo;The Sower,&rdquo; that marvellous strophe in his great poem on the
earth. By the produce of a vegetable garden he endeavoured to increase
his income, lived on credit with grocer and butcher, and at last had creditors
in every direction&mdash;in particular Gobillot, the baker of Chailly, from whom
he often hid at his friend Jacque&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>He was forced to accept a loaf from Rousseau for his famishing family,
and small sums with which he was subsidised by Diaz. &ldquo;I have received
the hundred francs,&rdquo; he writes in a letter to Sensier, &ldquo;and they came just at
the right time; neither my wife nor I had tasted food for four-and-twenty
hours. It is a blessing that the little ones, at any rate, have not been in want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All his efforts to exhibit in Paris were vain. Even in 1859 &ldquo;Death and
the Woodcutter&rdquo; was rejected by the Salon. The public laughed, being
accustomed to peasants in a comic opera, and, at best, his pictures were
honoured by a caricature in a
humorous paper. Even the
most delicate connoisseurs had
not the right historical perspective
to appreciate the
greatness of Millet, so far was
it in advance of the age.
And all this is so much the
sadder when one thinks of
the price which his works
fetched at a later period,
when one reads that drawings
for which he could get with
difficulty from twenty to forty
francs are the works for which
as many thousands are now
offered. It was only from
the middle of the fifties that
he began to sell at the rate
of from two hundred and fifty
to three hundred francs a
picture. Rousseau was the
first to offer him a large sum,
buying his &ldquo;Woodcutter&rdquo;
for four thousand francs, on
the pretext that an American
was the purchaser.  Dupré helped him to dispose of &ldquo;The Gleaners&rdquo; for
two thousand francs.  An agreement which the picture-dealer Arthur
Stevens, brother of Stevens the painter, concluded with him had to be
dissolved six months afterwards, since Millet&rsquo;s time had not yet come.  At
last, in 1863, when he painted four large decorative pictures&mdash;&ldquo;The Four
Seasons,&rdquo; which are, by the way, his weakest works&mdash;for the dining-room
of the architect Feydau, superfluity came in place of need.  He was
then in a position, like Rousseau and Jacque, to buy himself a little house
in Barbizon, close to the road by which the place is entered and opposite
Ganne&rsquo;s inn.  Wild vine, ivy, and jessamine clambered round it, and two
bushes of white roses twisted their branches around the window.  It was
surrounded by a large garden, in which field-flowers bloomed amongst
vegetables and fruit-trees, whilst a border of white roses and elders led to
another little house which he used as a studio.  Behind was a poultry-yard,
and behind that again a thickly grown little shrubbery.  Here he lived,
simple and upright, with his art and his own belongings, as a peasant and a
father of a family, like an Old Testament patriarch.  His father had had nine
children, and he himself had nine.  While he painted the little ones played
in the garden, the elder daughters worked, and when the younger children
made too much noise, Jeanne, who was seven years old, would say with gravity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page370" id="page370"></a>370</span>
&ldquo;<i>Chut! Papa travaille.</i>&rdquo;  After the evening meal he danced his youngest boy
upon his knee and told Norman tales, or they all went out together into the
forest, which the children called <i>la forêt noire</i>, because it was so wild, gloomy,
and magnificent.</p>

<p>Millet&rsquo;s poverty was not quite so great as might be supposed from Sensier&rsquo;s
book.  Chintreuil, Théodore Rousseau, and many others were acquainted
with poverty likewise, and bore it with courage.  It may even be said that,
all things considered, success came to Millet early.  The real misfortune for an
artist is to have had success, to have been rich, and later to see himself forgotten
when he is stricken with poverty.  Millet&rsquo;s course was the opposite.  From
the beginning of the sixties his reputation was no longer in question.  At the
World Exhibition of 1867 he was showered with all outward honours.  He
was represented by nine pictures and received the great medal.  The whole
world knew his name, subsistence was abundantly assured to him, and all the
younger class of artists honoured him like a god.  In the Salon of 1869 he was
on the hanging committee.  The picture-dealers, who had passed him by in
earlier days, now beset his doors; he lived to see his &ldquo;Woman with the Lamp&rdquo;
for which he had received a hundred and fifty francs, sold for thirty-eight
thousand five hundred at Richard&rsquo;s sale.  &ldquo;<i>Allons, ils commencent à comprendre
que c&rsquo;est de la peinture serieuse.</i>&rdquo;  M. de Chennevières commissioned him to
take part in the paintings in the Panthéon, and he began the work.  But
strength was denied him; he was prostrated by a violent fever, and on
20th January 1875, at six o&rsquo;clock in the morning, Millet was dead.  He was
then sixty.</p>

<p>His funeral, indeed, was celebrated with no great parade, for it took place
far from Paris.  It was a cold, dull morning, and there was mist and rain.
Not many friends had come, only a few painters and critics.  At eleven o&rsquo;clock
the procession was set in order.  And it moved in the rain quickly over the
two <i>centimètres</i> from Barbizon to Chailly.  Even those who had hastened
from various villages, drawn by curiosity, could not half fill the church.  But
in Paris the announcement of death raised all the greater stir.  When forty
newspapers were displayed in a picture-dealer&rsquo;s shop on the morning after
his demise, all Paris assembled and the excitement was universal.  In the
critical notices he was named in the same breath with Watteau, Leonardo,
Raphael, and Michael Angelo.  The auction which was held soon afterwards
in the Hôtel Drouot for the disposal of the sketches which he had left behind
him brought his family three hundred and twenty-one thousand francs.  And
in these days, the very drawings and pastels which were bought for six thousand
francs immediately after his death have on the average risen in value to thirty
thousand, while the greater number of his pictures rose to a figure beyond
the reach of European purchasers, and passed across the ocean to the happy
land of dollars.  Under such circumstances to speak any longer of Millet being
misunderstood, or to sing hymns of praise upon him as a counterblast to the
undervaluation of Millet in the beginning, would be knocking at an open door.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page371" id="page371"></a>371</span>
It is merely necessary to inquire in an entirely objective spirit what position
he occupies in the history of modern painting, and what future generations
will say of him.</p>

<p>Millet&rsquo;s importance is to some extent ethical; he is not the first who
painted peasants, but he is the first who has represented them truthfully, in
all their ruggedness, and likewise in their greatness&mdash;not for the amusement
of others, but as they claim a right to their own existence. The spirit of the
rustic is naturally grave and heavy, and the number of his ideas and emotions
is small. He has neither wit nor sentimentalism. And when in his leisure
moments he sometimes gives way to a broad, noisy merriment, his gaiety
often resembles intoxication, and is not infrequently its consequence. His
life, which forces him to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow, always
reminds him of the hard fundamental conditions of existence. He looks at
everything in a spirit of calculation and strict economy. Even the earth he
stands on wakens in him a mood of seriousness. It is gravely sublime, this
nature with its wide horizon and its boundless sky. At certain seasons it wears
a friendly smile, especially for those who have escaped for a few hours from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page372" id="page372"></a>372</span>
town. But for him who always lives in its midst it is not the good, tender
mother that the townsman fancies. It has its oppressive heats in summer
and its bitter winter frosts; its majesty is austere. And nowhere more
austere than in Millet&rsquo;s home, amid those plains of Normandy, swept by the
rude wind, where he spent his youth as a farm labourer.</p>

<p>From this peasant life, painting, before his time, had collected merely
trivial anecdotes with a conventional optimism. It was through no very
adequate conception of man that peasants, in those earlier pictures, had
always to be celebrating marriages, golden weddings, and baptisms, dancing
rustic dances, making comic proposals, behaving themselves awkwardly with
advocates, or scuffling in the tavern for the amusement of those who frequent
exhibitions. They had really won their right to existence by their labour.
&ldquo;The most joyful thing I know,&rdquo; writes Millet in a celebrated letter to Sensier
in 1851, &ldquo;is the peace, the silence, that one enjoys in the woods or on the tilled
lands. One sees a poor, heavily laden creature with a bundle of faggots
advancing from a narrow path in the fields. The manner in which this figure
comes suddenly before one is a momentary reminder of the fundamental
condition of human life, toil. On the tilled land around one watches figures
hoeing and digging. One sees how this or that one rises and wipes away the
sweat with the back of his hand. &lsquo;In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat
bread.&rsquo; Is that merry, enlivening work, as some people would like to persuade
us? And yet it is here that I find the true humanity, the great poetry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps in his conception of peasant life Millet has been even a little too
serious; perhaps his melancholy spirit has looked too much on the sad side
of the peasant&rsquo;s life. For Millet was altogether a man of temperament and
feelings. His family life had made him so even as a boy. To see this, one
needs only to read in Sensier&rsquo;s book of his old grandmother, who was his
godmother likewise, to hear how he felt in after-years the news of his father&rsquo;s
death and of his mother&rsquo;s, and how he burst into tears because he had not
given his last embrace to the departed. Of course, a man who was so sad
and dreamy might be expected to lay special stress on the dark side of rustic
life, its toil and trouble and exhaustion. He had not that easy spirit which
<i>amara lento temperat risu</i>. The passage beneath the peasant-picture in
Holbein&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dance of Death&rdquo; might stand as motto for his whole work&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">This grave and sad trait in Millet&rsquo;s character sets him, for example, in abrupt
contrast with Corot. Corot had a cheerful temperament, which noticed
what was kindly in nature everywhere. His favourite hour was morning,
when the sun rises and the lark exults, when the mists are dissipated and the
shining dew lies upon the grass like pearls. His favourite season was spring,
bringing with the new leaves life and joy upon the earth. And if he sometimes
peopled this laughing world with peasant lads and maidens in place of the
joyous creatures of his fancy, they were only those for whom life is a feast
rather than a round of hard toil. Compared with so sanguine a man as Corot,
Millet is melancholy all through; whilst the former renders the spring, the latter
chooses the oppressive and enervating sultriness of summer. From experience
he knew that hard toil which makes men old before their time, which kills
body and spirit, and turns the image of God into an ugly, misshapen, and
rheumatic thing; and perhaps he has been one-sided in seeing only this in the
life of the peasant. Nevertheless, it is inapposite to cite as a parallel to Millet&rsquo;s
paintings of the peasant that cruel description of the rustic made in the time
of Louis <span class="sc">XIV</span> by Labruyère: &ldquo;One sees scattered over the field dwarfed
creatures that look like some strange kind of animal, black, withered, and
sun-burnt, fastened to the earth, in which they grub with invincible stubbornness;
they have something resembling articulate language, and when they raise
themselves they show a human countenance,&mdash;as a matter of fact they are
men. At night they retire to their holes, where they live on black bread,
water, and roots. They save other men the trouble of sowing, ploughing, and
gathering in the harvest, and so gain the advantage of not themselves being
in want of the bread that
they have sown.&rdquo; Yes,
Millet&rsquo;s peasants toil, and
they toil hard, but in bowing
over the earth at their work
they are, in a sense, proudly
raised by their whole peasant
nature. Millet has made
human beings out of the
manikins of illustrated
humour, and in this lies his
ethical greatness.</p>

<p>As his whole life passed
without untruth or artificiality,
so his whole endeavour
as an artist was to keep
artificiality and untruth at a
distance. After a period of
<i>genre</i> painting which disposed
of things in an arbitrary
manner, he opened a way
for the new movement with
its unconditional devotion
to reality. The &ldquo;historical
painters&rdquo; having conjured
up the past with the assistance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page376" id="page376"></a>376</span>
of old masterpieces, it was something to the credit of the <i>genre</i>
painters that, instead of looking back, they began to look around them.
Fragments of reality were arranged&mdash;in correspondence with the principle of
Classical landscape painting&mdash;according to the rules of composition known
to history to make <i>tableaux vivants</i> crowded with figures; and such pictures
related a cheerful or a moving episode of the painter&rsquo;s invention. Millet&rsquo;s
virtue is to have set emotion in the place of invention, to have set a part of
nature grasped in its totality with spontaneous freshness in the place of composition
pieced together from scattered observation and forcing life into inconsistent
relations&mdash;to have set painting in the place of history and anecdote.
As Rousseau and his fellows discovered the poetry of work-a-day nature,
Millet discovered that of ordinary life. The foundation of modern art could
only be laid on painting which no longer subjected the world to one-sided
rules of beauty, but set itself piously to watch for the beauty of things as they
were, and renounced all literary episodes. Millet does not appear to think
that any one is listening to him; he communes with himself alone. He does
not care to make his ideas thoroughly distinct and salient by repetitions and
antitheses; he renders his emotion, and that is all. And thus painting
receives new life from him: his pictures are not compositions that one sees,
but emotions that one feels; it is not a painter who speaks through them, but,
a man. From the first he had the faculty of seeing things simply, directly,
and naturally; and to exercise himself in this faculty he began with the
plainest things: a labourer in the field, resting upon his spade and looking
straight before him; a sower amid the furrows, on which flights of birds are
settling down; a man standing in a ploughed field, putting on his coat; a
woman stitching in a room; a girl at the window behind a pot of marguerites.
He is never weary of drawing land broken up for cultivation, and oftener still
he draws huddled flocks of sheep upon a heath, their woolly backs stretching
with an undulatory motion, and a shepherd lad or a girl in their midst.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Sower&rdquo; (1850), &ldquo;The Peasants going to their Work,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Hay-trussers,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Reapers,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Sheep-shearer,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Labourer grafting a
Tree&rdquo; (1855), &ldquo;A Shepherd,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Gleaners&rdquo; (1857) are his principal
works in the fifties. And what a deep intuition of nature is to be found in
&ldquo;The Gleaners&rdquo;! They have no impassioned countenances, and their
movements aim at no declamatory effect of contrast. They do not seek
compassion, but merely do their work. It is this which gives them loftiness
and dignity. They are themselves products of nature, plants of which the
commonest is not without a certain pure and simple beauty. Look at their
hands. They are not hands to be kissed, but to be cordially pressed. They
are brave hands, which have done hard work from youth upwards&mdash;reddened
with frost, chapped by soda, swollen with toil, or burnt by the sun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Labourer grafting a Tree&rdquo; of 1855 is entirely idyllic. In the midst
of one of those walled-in spaces which are half courtyard and half garden,
separating in villages the barns from the house, there is standing a man
who has cut a tree and is grafting a fresh twig. His wife is looking on, with
their youngest child in her arms. Everything around bears the mark of order,
cleanliness, and content. Their clothes have neither spot nor hole, and wear
well under the anxious care of the wife. Here is the old French peasant, true
to the soil, and living and dying in the place of his birth: it is a picture of
patriarchal simplicity. In 1859 appeared &ldquo;The Angelus,&rdquo; that work which
chimes like a low-toned and far-off peal of bells. &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;I
mean the bells to be heard sounding, and only natural truth of expression can
produce the effect.&rdquo; Nothing is wanting in these creations, neither simplicity
nor truth. The longer they are looked at, the more something is seen in them
which goes beyond reality. &ldquo;The Man with the Mattock,&rdquo; the celebrated
picture of 1863, is altogether a work of great style; it recalls antique statues
and the figures of Michael Angelo, without in any way resembling them. In
his daring veracity Millet despised all the artificial grace and arbitrary
beatification which others introduced into rustic life; and while, in turning
from it, he rested only on the most conscientious reverence for nature, his
profound draughtsmanlike knowledge of the human form has given a dignity
and a large style to the motions of the peasant which no one discovered before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page378" id="page378"></a>378</span>
his time. There is a simplicity, a harmony, and a largeness in the lines of
his pictures such as only the greatest artists have had. He reached it in the
same way as Rousseau and Corot reached their style in landscape: absorbed
and saturated by reality, he was able, in the moment of creation, to dispense
with the model without suffering for it, and to attain truth and condensation
without being hindered by petty detail.</p>

<p>He himself went about in Barbizon like a peasant. And he might have been
seen wandering over the woods and fields with an old, red cloak, wooden shoes,
and a weather-beaten straw hat. He rose at sunrise, and wandered about
the country as his parents had done. He guarded no flocks, drove no cows,
and no yokes of oxen or horses; he carried neither mattock nor spade, but
rested on his stick; he was equipped only with the faculty of observation and
poetic intuition. He went about like the people he met, roamed round the
houses, entered the courtyards, looked over the hedges, knew the gleaners
and reapers, the girls who took care of the geese, and the shepherds in their
big cloaks, as they stood motionless amongst their flocks, resting on a staff.
He entered the wash-house, the bake-house, and the dairies where the butter
was being churned. He
witnessed the birth of a
calf or the death of a pig,
or leant with folded arms
on the garden wall and
looked into the setting sun,
as it threw a rosy veil over
field and forest. He heard
the chime of vesper bells,
watched the people pray
and then return home.
And he returned also, and
read the Bible by lamplight,
while his wife sewed
and the children slept.
When all was quiet he
closed the book and began
to dream. Once more he
saw all that he had come
across in the course of the
day. He had gone out
without canvas or colours;
he had merely noted down
in passing a few motives in
his sketch-book: as a rule
he never took his pencil
from his pocket, but merely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page379" id="page379"></a>379</span>
meditated, his mind being compelled to notice all that his eye saw. Then
he went through it again in his memory. On the morrow he painted.</p>

<p>His study seems to have been an incessant exercise of the eye to see and
to retain the essential, the great lines in nature as in the human body.
Advancing upon Daumier&rsquo;s path, he divested figures of all that is merely
accidental, and simplified them, to bring the character and ground-note more
into relief. This simplification, this marvellous way of expressing forcibly
as much as possible with the smallest means, no one has ever understood like
Millet. There is nothing superfluous, nothing petty, and everything bears
witness to an epic spirit attracted by what is great and heroic. His drawing
was never encumbered by what was subsidiary and anecdotic; his mind was
fixed on the decisive lines which characterise a movement, and give it rhythm.
It was just this feeling for rhythm which his harmonious nature possessed in
the very highest degree. He did not give his peasants Grecian noses, and he
never lost himself in arid and trivial observation; he simplified and sublimated
their outlines, making them the heroes and martyrs of toil. His figures have
a majesty of style, an august grandeur; and something almost resembling
the antique style of relief is found in his pictures. It is no doubt characteristic
that the only works of art which he had in his studio were plaster casts of the
metopes of the Parthenon. He himself was like a man of antique times, both
in the simplicity of his life and in his outward appearance&mdash;a peasant in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page380" id="page380"></a>380</span>
wooden shoes who had, set upon his shoulders, the head of the Zeus of Otricoli.
And as his biography reads like an Homeric poem, so his great and simple
art sought for what was primitive, aboriginal, and heroic. Note the Michelangelesque
motions of &ldquo;The Sower.&rdquo; The peasant, striding on with a firm
tread, seems to show by his large movements his consciousness of the grandeur
of his daily toil: he is the heroic embodiment of man, swaying the earth,
making it fruitful and subservient to his own purposes.</p>

<p>Note the epical quietude of &ldquo;The Gleaners,&rdquo; the three Fates of poverty, as
Gautier called them, the priestly dignity of &ldquo;The Woodcutter,&rdquo; the almost
Indian solemnity of &ldquo;The Woman leading her Cow to Grass.&rdquo; She stands
in her wooden shoes as if on a pedestal, her dress falls into sculpturesque folds,
and a grave and melancholy
hebetude is imprinted on her
countenance. Millet is the
Michael Angelo of peasants.
In their large simplicity his
pictures make the appeal of
religious painting, at once
plastic and mystical.</p>

<p>But it is in no sense
merely through instinct that
Millet has attained this altitude
of style. Although the
son of a peasant, and himself
a peasant and the painter of
peasants, he knew thoroughly
well what he wanted to do;
and this aim of his he has
not only formulated practically
in his pictures, but has
made theoretically clear in
his letters and treatises. For
Millet was not simply a man
who had a turn for dreaming;
he had, at the same time, a
brooding, philosophic mind, in
which the ideas of a thinker
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page381" id="page381"></a>381</span>
were harboured beside the emotions of a poet. In the portrait of himself,
given on the title-page of Sensier&rsquo;s book, a portrait in which he has something
sickly, something ethereal and tinged with romance, only one side of his
nature is expressed. The great medallion of Chappu reveals the other side:
the keen, consecutive thinker, to be found in the luminous and remorselessly
logical letters. In this respect he is the true representative of his race. In
opposition to the <i>esprit</i> and graceful levity of the Parisian, a quieter and
more healthy human understanding counts as the chief characteristic of the
Norman; and this clear and precise capacity for thought was intensified in

<p>Even as a child he had received a good education from his uncle, who was
an ecclesiastic, and he learnt enough Latin to read the <i>Georgics</i> of Virgil and
other ancient authors in the original text. He knows them almost by heart,
and cites them continually in his letters. When he came to Paris he spent
long hours in the galleries, not copying this or that portion of a picture, but
fathoming works of art to their inmost core with a clear eye. In Cherbourg
he devoured the whole of Vasari in the library, and read all he could find
about Dürer, Leonardo, Michael Angelo, and Poussin. Even in Barbizon he
remained throughout his whole life an eager reader. Shakespeare fills him
with admiration; Theocritus and Burns are his favourite poets. &ldquo;Theocritus
makes it evident to me,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;that one is never more Greek than when
one simply renders one&rsquo;s own impressions, let them come whence they may.&rdquo;
When not painting or studying nature he had always a book in his hand, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page382" id="page382"></a>382</span>
knew no more cordial pleasure than when a friend increased his little library
by the present of a fresh one. Though in his youth he tilled the ground and
ploughed, and in later days lived like a peasant, he was better instructed than
most painters; he was a philosopher, a scholar. His manner in speaking
was leisurely, quiet, persuasive, full of conviction, and impregnated by his
own peculiar ideas, which he had thoroughly thought out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Millet,&rdquo; wrote a critic, &ldquo;you must sometimes see good-looking
peasants and pretty country girls.&rdquo; To which Millet replied: &ldquo;No doubt;
but beauty does not lie in the face. It lies in the harmony between man and
his industry. Your pretty country girls prefer to go up to town; it does not
suit them to glean and gather faggots and pump water. Beauty is expression.
When I paint a mother I try to render her beautiful by the mere look she
gives her child.&rdquo; He goes on to say that what has been once clearly seen is
beautiful if it is simply and sincerely interpreted. Everything is beautiful
which is in its place, and nothing is beautiful which appears out of place.
Therefore no emasculation of characters is ever beautiful. Apollo is Apollo
and Socrates is Socrates. Mingle them and they both lose, and become a
mixture which is neither fish nor flesh. This was what brought about the
decadence of modern art. &ldquo;<i>Au lieu de naturaliser l&rsquo;art, ils artialisent la
nature.</i>&rdquo; The Luxembourg Gallery had shown him that he ought not to go to
the theatre to create true art. &ldquo;<i>Je voudrais que les êtres que je représente aient
l&rsquo;air voués à leur position; et qu&rsquo;il soit impossible d&rsquo;imaginer qu&rsquo;il leur puisse
venir à l&rsquo;idée d&rsquo;être autre chose que ce qu&rsquo;ils sont. On est dans un milieu d&rsquo;un
caractère ou d&rsquo;un autre, mais celui qu&rsquo;on adopte doit primer. On devrait être
habitué à ne recevoir de la nature ses impressions de quelque sorte qu&rsquo;elles soient
et quelque temperament qu&rsquo;on ait. Il faut être imprégné et saturé d&rsquo;elle, et ne
penser que ce qu&rsquo;elle vous fait penser. Il faut croire qu&rsquo;elle est assez riche pour
fournir à tout. Et où puiserait-on, sinon à la source? Pourquoi donc à
perpétuité proposer aux gens, comme but suprême à atteindre, ce que de hautes
intelligences ont découvert en elle. Voila donc qu&rsquo;on rendrait les productions
de quelques-uns le type et le but de toutes les productions à venir. Les gens de
génie sont comme doués de la baguette divinatoire; les uns découvrent que, dans
la nature, ici se trouve cela, les autres autre chose ailleurs, selon le temperament
de leur flair. Leurs productions vous assurent dans cette idée que celui-là trouve
qui est fait pour trouver, mais il est plaisant de voir, quand le trésor est déterré
et enlevé, que des gens viennent à perpétuité gratter à cette place-là. Il faut savoir
découvrir où il y a des truffes. Un chien qui n&rsquo;a pas de flair ne peut que faire
triste chasse, puisqu&rsquo;il ne va qu&rsquo;en voyant chasser celui qui sent la bête et qui
naturellement va le premier.... Un immense orgueil ou une immense sottise
seulement peut faire croire à certains hommes qu&rsquo;ils sont de force à redresser les
prétendus manques de goût et les erreurs de la nature. Les &oelig;uvres que nous
aimons, ce n&rsquo;est qu&rsquo;à cause qu&rsquo;elles procèdent d&rsquo;elle. Les autres ne sont que des
&oelig;uvres pédantes et vides. On peut partir de tous les points pour arriver au
sublime, et tout est propre à l&rsquo;exprimer, si on a une assez haute visée. Alors ce</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page383" id="page383"></a>383</span>
<i>que vous aimez avec le plus d&rsquo;emportement et de passion devient votre beau à vous
et qui s&rsquo;impose aux autres. Que chacun apporte le sien. L&rsquo;impression force
l&rsquo;expression. Tout l&rsquo;arsenal de la nature est à la disposition des hommes. Qui
oserait décider qu&rsquo;une pomme de terre est inférieure à une grenade.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus he maintains that when a stunted tree grows upon sterile soil it is
more beautiful in this particular place, because more natural, than a slender
tree artificially transplanted. &ldquo;The beautiful is that which is in keeping.
Whether this is to be called realism or idealism I do not know. For me, there
is only one manner of painting, and that is to paint with fidelity.&rdquo; In what
concerns poetry old Boileau has already expressed this in the phrase:
&ldquo;Nothing is beautiful except truth&rdquo;; and Schiller has thrown it into the
phrase, &ldquo;Let us, ultimately, set up truth for beauty.&rdquo; For the art of the
nineteenth century Millet&rsquo;s words mean the erection of a new principle, of a
principle that had the effect of a novel force, that gave the consciousness
of a new energy of artistic endeavour, that was a return to that which the
earth was to Antæus. And by formulating this principle&mdash;the principle that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page384" id="page384"></a>384</span>
everything is beautiful so far as it is true, and nothing beautiful so far as it is
untrue, that beauty is the blossom, but truth the tree&mdash;by clearly formulating
this principle for the first time, Millet has become the father of the new French
and, indeed, of European art, almost more than by his own pictures.</p>

<p>For&mdash;and here we come to the limitations of his talent&mdash;has Millet as a
painter really achieved what he aimed at? No less a person than Fromentin
has put this question in his <i>Maîtres d&rsquo;autrefois</i>. On his visit to Holland he
chances for a moment to speak of Millet, and he writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An entirely original painter, high-minded and disposed to brooding,
kind-hearted and genuinely rustic in nature, he has expressed things about
the country and its inhabitants, about their toil, their melancholy, and the
nobleness of their labour, which a Dutchman would never have discovered.
He has represented them in a somewhat barbaric fashion, in a manner to
which his ideas gave a more expressive force than his hand possessed. The
world has been grateful for his intentions; it has recognised in his method
something of the sensibility
of a Burns who
was a little awkward in
expression. But has he
left good pictures behind
him or not? Has his
articulation of form, his
method of expression, I
mean the envelopment
without which his ideas
could not exist, the
qualities of a good style
of painting, and does it
afford an enduring testimony?
He stands out
as a deep thinker if he
is compared with Potter
and Cuyp; he is an enthralling
dreamer if he is
opposed to Terborch and
Metsu, and he has something
peculiarly noble
compared with the trivialities
of Steen, Ostade,
and Brouwer. As a man
he puts them all to the
blush. Does he outweigh
them as a painter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>If any one thinks of
Millet as a draughtsman he will answer this question without hesitation in
the affirmative. His power is firmly rooted in the drawings which constitute
half his work. And he has not merely drawn to make sketches
or preparations for pictures, like Leonardo, Raphael, Michael Angelo,
Watteau, or Delacroix; his drawings were for him real works of art complete
in themselves; and his enduring and firmly grounded fame rests
upon them. Michael Angelo, Raphael, Leonardo, Rubens, Rembrandt,
Prudhon, Millet; that is, more or less, the roll of the greatest draughtsmen
in the history of art. His pastels and etchings, his drawings in chalk,
pencil, and charcoal, are astonishing through their eminent delicacy of
technique. The simpler the medium the greater is the effect achieved. &ldquo;The
Woman Churning&rdquo; in the Louvre; the quietude of his men reaping, and of
his woman-reaper beside the heaps of corn; &ldquo;The Water Carriers,&rdquo; who
are like Greek kanephoræ; the peasant upon the potato-field, lighting his
pipe with a flint and a piece of tinder; the woman sewing by the lamp beside
her sleeping child; the vine-dresser resting; the little shepherdess sitting
dreamily on a bundle of straw near her flock at pasture,&mdash;in all these works
in black and white he is as great as he is as a colourist and as a painter in open
air. There are no sportive and capricious sunbeams, as in Diaz. Millet&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page386" id="page386"></a>386</span>
sun is too serious merely to play over the fields; it is the austere day-star,
ripening the harvest, forcing men to sweat over their toil and with no time
to waste in jest. And as a landscape painter he differs from Corot in the
same vital manner.</p>

<p>Corot, the old bachelor, dallies with nature; Millet, nine times a father,
knows her only as the fertile mother, nourishing all her children. The
temperament of the brooding, melancholy man breaks out in his very conception
of nature: &ldquo;Oh, if they knew how beautiful the forest is! I stroll
into it sometimes of an evening, and always return with a sense of being
overwhelmed. It has a quiet and majesty which are terrible, so that I have
often a feeling of actual fear. I do not know what the trees talk about amongst
themselves, but they say to each other something which we do not understand,
because we do not speak the same language. That they are not making
bad jokes seems certain.&rdquo; He loved what Corot has never painted&mdash;the
sod, the sod as sod, the sod which steams beneath the rays of the fertilising
sun. And yet, despite all difference of temperament, he stands beside Corot
as perhaps the greatest landscape painter of the century. His landscapes
are vacant and devoid of charm; they smell of the earth rather than of jessamine,
yet it is as if the Earth-Spirit itself were invisibly brooding over them.
A few colours enable him to attain that great harmony which is elsewhere
peculiar to Corot alone, and which, when his work was over, he so often discussed
with his neighbour Rousseau. With a few brilliant and easily executed
shadings he gives expression to the vibration of the atmosphere, the lustre
of the sky at sunset, the massive structure of the ground, the blissful tremor
upon the plain at sunrise. At one time he renders the morning mist lying
over the fields, at another the haze of sultry noon, veiling and as it were
absorbing the outlines and colours of all objects, the light of sunset streaming
over field and woodland with a tender, tremulous glimmering, the delicate
silver tone which veils the landscape on clear moonlight nights.</p>

<p>There is not another artist of the century who renders night as Millet
does in his pastels. One of the most charming and poetic works is the biblical
and mystical night-piece &ldquo;The Flight into Egypt.&rdquo; As he strides forward
Saint Joseph holds upon his arm the Child, whose head is surrounded by a
shining halo, whilst the Mother moves slowly along the banks of the Nile
riding upon an ass. The stars twinkle, the moon throws its tremulous light
uncertainly over the plain. Joseph and Mary are Barbizon peasants, and
yet these great figures breathe of the Sistine Chapel and of Michael Angelo.
And which of the old masters has so eloquently rendered the sacred silence
of night as Millet has done in his &ldquo;Shepherd at the Pen&rdquo;? The landscapes
which he has drawn awaken the impression of spaciousness as only Rembrandt&rsquo;s
etchings have done, and that of fine atmosphere as only Corot&rsquo;s
pictures. A marvellously transparent and tender evening sky rests over
his picture of cows coming down to drink at the lake, and a liquid moonlight
washes over the crests of the waves around &ldquo;The Sailing Boat.&rdquo; The garden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page387" id="page387"></a>387</span>
in stormy light
with a high-lying
avenue spanned
by a rainbow&mdash;the
motive which he
developed for the
well-known picture
in the Louvre&mdash;is
found again
and again in
several pastels,
which progress
from a simple to
a more complicated
treatment
of the theme.
Everything is
transparent and
delicate, full of air
and light, and the air and light are themselves full of magic and melting
charm.</p>

<p>But it is a different matter when one attempts to answer Fromentin&rsquo;s
question in the form in which it is put. For without in any way detracting
from Millet&rsquo;s importance, one may quietly make the declaration: No, Millet
was <i>not</i> a good painter. Later generations, with which he will no longer be
in touch through his ethical greatness, if they consider his paintings alone,
will scarcely understand the high estimation in which he is held at present.
For although many works which have come into private collections in
Boston, New York, and Baltimore are, in their original form, withdrawn from
judgment, they are certainly not better than the many works brought
together in the Millet Exhibition of 1886 or the World Exhibition of 1889.
And these had collectively a clumsiness, and a dry and heavy colouring,
which are not merely old-fashioned, primitive, and antediluvian in comparison
with the works of modern painters, but which fall far below the level of
their own time in the quality of colour. The conception in Millet&rsquo;s paintings
is always admirable, but never the technique; he makes his appeal as a poet
only, and never as a painter. His painting is often anxiously careful, heavy,
and thick, and looks as if it had been filled in with masonry; it is dirty and
dismal, and wanting in free and airy tones. Sometimes it is brutal and
hard, and occasionally it is curiously indecisive in effect. Even his best
pictures&mdash;&ldquo;The Angelus&rdquo; not excepted&mdash;give no æsthetic pleasure to the
eye. The most ordinary fault in his painting is that it is soft, greasy, and
woolly. He is not light enough with what should be light, nor fleeting enough
with what is fleeting. And this defect is especially felt in his treatment of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page388" id="page388"></a>388</span>
clothes. They are of a massive, distressing solidity, as if moulded in brass,
and not woven from flax and wool. The same is true of his air, which has
an oily and material effect. Even in &ldquo;The Gleaners&rdquo; the aspect is cold and
gloomy; it is without the intensity of light which is shed through the atmosphere,
and streams ever changing over the earth.</p>

<p>And this is a declaration of what was left for later artists to achieve. The
problem of putting real human beings in their true surroundings was stated
by Millet, solved in his pastels, and left unsolved in his oil paintings. This
same problem had to be taken up afresh by his successors, and followed to
its furthest consequences. At the same time, it was necessary to widen the
choice of subject.</p>

<p>For it is characteristic of Millet, the great peasant, that his art is exclusively
concerned with peasants. His sensitive spirit, which from youth
upwards had compassion for the hard toil and misery of the country folk,
was blind to the sufferings of the artisans of the city, amid whom he had
lived in Paris in his student days. The <i>ouvrier</i>, too, has his poetry and his
grandeur. As there is a cry of the earth, so is there also a cry, as loud and
as eloquent, which goes up from the pavement of great cities. Millet lived
in Paris during a critical and terrible time. He was there during the years
of ferment at the close of the reign of Louis Philippe. Around him there
muttered all the terrors of Socialism and Communism. He was there during
the February Revolution and during the days of June. While the artisans
fought on the barricades he was painting &ldquo;The Winnower.&rdquo; The misery
of Paris and the sufferings of the populace did not move him. Millet, the
peasant, had a heart only for the peasantry. He was blind to the sufferings,
blind to the charms of modern city life. Paris seemed to him a &ldquo;miserable,
dirty nest.&rdquo; There was no picturesque aspect of the great town that fascinated
him. He felt neither its grace, its elegance and charming frivolity, nor remarked
the mighty modern movement of ideas and the noble humanity
which set their seal upon that humanitarian century. The development of
French art had to move in both of these directions. It was partly necessary
to take up afresh with improved instruments the problem of the modern
conception of colour, touched on by Millet; it was partly necessary to extend
from the painting of peasants to modern life the principle formulated by
Millet, &ldquo;<i>Le beau c&rsquo;est le vrai</i>,&rdquo; to transfer it from the forest of Fontainebleau
to Paris, from the solitude to life, from the evening gloom to sunlight, from
the softness of romance to hard reality.</p>

<p class="pt2">The fourth book of this work will be devoted to the consideration of
those masters who, acting on this principle, extended beyond the range of
Millet and brought the art which he had created to fuller fruition.</p>

<p class="center chap2">REALISM IN FRANCE</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">To</span> continue in Paris what Millet had begun in the solitude of the forest
of Fontainebleau there was need of a man of the unscrupulous animal
power of <i>Gustave Courbet</i>. The task assigned to him was similar to that
which fell to Caravaggio in the seventeenth century. In that age, when the
eclectic imitation of the Cinquecento had reached the acme of mannerism, when
Carlo Dolci and Sassoferato devoted themselves in mythological pictures
to watering down the types of Raphael by idealising, Caravaggio painted
scenes amongst dregs of the people and the unbridled soldiery of his age.
At a period when these artists indulged in false, artificial, and doctrinaire
compositions, which, on a barren system, merely traced the performances of
classic masters back to certain rules of art, Caravaggio created works which
may have been coarse, but which had an earnest and fruitful veracity, and
gave the entire art of the seventeenth century another direction by their
healthy and powerful naturalism.</p>

<p>When Courbet appeared the situation was similar: Ingres, in whose
frigid works the whole Cinquecento had been crystallised, was at the zenith
of his fame. Couture had painted his &ldquo;Decadent Romans&rdquo; and Cabanel
had recorded his first successes. Beside these stood that little Neo-Grecian
school with Louis Hamon at its head&mdash;a school whose prim style of china
painting had the peculiar admiration of the public. Courbet, with all his
brutal weight, pushed between the large symmetrical figures of the thoroughbred
Classicists and the pretty confectionery of the Neo-Grecian painters of
beauty. But the old panacea is never without effect: in all periods when
art has overlived its bloom and falls into mannerism it is met by a strong
cross-current of realism pouring into it new life-blood. In painting, nature
had been made artificial, and it was time for art to be made natural. Painters
still strayed in the past, seeking to awaken the dead, and give life once more
to history. The time had come for accentuating the claims of the present
more sharply than before, and for setting art amid the seething life of modern
cities: it was a development naturally and logically following that of political
life; it is historically united with the unintermittent struggle for universal
suffrage. Courbet merely fought the decisive battle in the great fight which
Jeanron, Leleux, Octave Tassaert, and others had begun as skirmishing
outposts. As a painter he towered over these elder artists, whose sentimental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page392" id="page392"></a>392</span>
pictures had not been taken seriously as works of art, and challenged attention
all the more by painting life-size. In this manner the last obstacle was
removed which had stood in the way of the treatment of modern subjects.
Scanty notice had been taken of Millet&rsquo;s little peasant figures, which were
merely reckoned as accessories to the landscape. But Courbet&rsquo;s pictures
first taught the Academy that the &ldquo;picture of manners,&rdquo; which had seemed
so harmless, had begun to usurp the place of historical painting in all its
pride.</p>

<p>At the same time&mdash;and this made Courbet&rsquo;s appearance of still more
consequence than that of his predecessors&mdash;a most effective literary propaganda
went hand in hand with that which was artistic. Millet had been
silent and was known only by his friends. He had never arranged for an
exhibition of his works, and quietly suffered the rejections of the hanging
committee and the derision of the public. Courbet blustered, beat the big
drum, threw himself into forcible postures like a strong man juggling with
cannon-balls, and announced in the press that he was the only serious artist
of the century. No one could ever <i>embêter le bourgeois</i> with such success, no
one has called forth such a howl of passion, no one so complacently surrendered
his private life to the curiosity of the great public, with the swaggering
attitude of an athlete displaying his muscles in the circus. As regards this
method of making an appearance&mdash;a method by which he became at times
almost grotesque&mdash;one may take whatever view one pleases; but when he
came he was necessary. In art revolutions are made with the same brutality
as in life. People shout and sing, and break the windows of those who have
windows to break. For every revolution has a character of inflexible harshness.
Wisdom and reason have no part in the passions necessary for the
work of destruction and rebuilding. Caravaggio was obliged to take to his
weapons, and make sanguinary onslaughts. In our civilised nineteenth
century everything was accomplished according to law, but not with less
passion. One has to make great demands to receive even a little; this has
been true in all times, and this is precisely what Courbet did. He was a
remarkable character striving for high aims, an eccentric man of genius, a
modern Narcissus for ever contemplating himself in his vanity, and yet he
was the truest friend, the readiest to sacrifice himself; for the crowd a cynic
and a reckless talker; at home an earnest and mighty toiler, bursting out like
a child and appeased the very next moment; outwardly as brutal as he was
inwardly sensitive, as egotistic as he was proud and independent; and being
what he was, he formulated his purposes as incisively by his words as in his
works. Full of fire and enthusiasm, destroying and inciting to fresh creation&mdash;a
nature like Lorenz Gedon, whom he also resembled in appearance&mdash;he
became the soul and motive power of the great realistic movement which
flooded Europe from the beginning of the fifties. Altogether he was the
man of whom art had need at that time: a doctor who brought health with
him, shed it abroad, and poured blood into the veins of art. Both as man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page393" id="page393"></a>393</span>
and artist his entry upon the
arena is in some degree like
the breaking in of an elemental
force of nature. He comes
from the country in wooden
shoes, with the self-reliance of
a peasant who is afraid of
nothing. He is a great and
powerful man, as sound and
natural as the oxen of his birthplace.
He had broad shoulders,
with which he pushed aside
everything standing in his way.
His was an instinct rather than
a reflecting brain, a <i>peintre-animal</i>,
as he was called by a
Frenchman. And such a plebeian
was wanted to beat down the
academic Olympus. In making
him great and strong, nature
had herself predestined him for
the part he had to play: a man
makes a breach the more easily
for having big muscles. Furnished
with the strength of a Samson wrecking the temple of the Philistines,
he was himself &ldquo;The Stone-breaker&rdquo; of his art, and, like the men he painted,
he has done a serviceable day&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>Gustave Courbet, the strong son of Franche-Comté, was born in 1819, in
Ornans, a little town near Besançon. Like his friend and fellow-countryman
Proudhon, the socialist, he had a strain of German blood in his veins,
and in their outward appearance it gave them both something Teutonic,
rugged, and heavy, contrasting with French ease and elegance. On his
massive frame was set a thick, athletic neck, and a broad countenance with
black hair, and big, strong eyes like those of a lion-tamer, which sparkled
like black diamonds. A strong man, who had never been stinted, he was
of medium height, broad-shouldered, bluff, ruddy like a slaughterman, and,
as the years passed, disposed to acquire a more liberal circumference of body.
He went about working like Sisyphus, and never without a short pipe in his
mouth, the classic <i>brûle-gueule</i>, loaded with strong caporal. His movements
were broad and heavy, and, being a little short in his breathing, he wheezed
when he was excited, and perspired over his painting. His dress was comfortable,
but not elegant; and his head was formed for a cap rather than
the official tall hat. In speech he was cynical, and often broke into a contemptuous
laugh. Both in his studio and at his tavern he moved more freely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page394" id="page394"></a>394</span>
in his shirt-sleeves, and at the Munich Exhibition of 1869 he seemed to the
German painters like a thorough old Bavarian, when he sat down to drink
with them at the <i>Deutsches Haus</i> in his jovial way, and, by a rather Teutonic
than Latin capacity for disposing of beer, threw the most inveterate of the
men of Munich into the shade.</p>

<p>Originally destined for the law, he determined in 1837 to become a painter,
and began his artistic studies under Flageoulot, a mediocre artist of the
school of David, who had drifted into the provinces, and boastfully called
himself <i>le roi du dessin</i>. In 1839 he came to Paris, already full of self-reliance,
fire and strength. On his first turn through the Luxembourg Gallery he
paused before Delacroix&rsquo;s &ldquo;Massacre of Chios,&rdquo; glowing as it is in colour,
and said it was not bad, but that he could do that style of thing whenever
he liked. After a short time he acquired a power of execution full of
bravura by studying the old masters in the Louvre. Self-taught in art,
he was in life a democrat and in politics a republican. In 1848, during
a battle in June, he had a fair prospect of being shot with a party of
insurgents whom he had joined, if certain &ldquo;right-minded&rdquo; citizens had not
interceded for their neighbour, who was popular as a man and already much
talked about as a painter. In the beginning of the fifties he was to be
found every evening at a <i>brasserie</i> much frequented by artists and students
in the Rue Hautefeuille in the <i>Quartier Latin</i>, in the society of young authors
of the school of Balzac. He had his studio at the end of the street,
and is said to have been at the
time a strong, fine, spirited young
man, who made free use of the drastic
slang of the studios.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His notable features,&rdquo; writes
Théophile Silvestre of Courbet at this
time,&mdash;&ldquo;his notable features seem
as though they had been modelled
from an Assyrian bas-relief. His
well-shaped and brilliant dark eyes,
shadowed by long silken lashes, have
the soft quiet light of an antelope&rsquo;s.
The moustache, scarcely traceable
beneath his slightly curved aquiline
nose, is joined by a fan-shaped beard,
and borders his thick, sensuous lips;
his complexion is olive-brown, but
of a changing, sensitive tone. The
round, curiously shaped head and
prominent cheek-bones denote stubbornness,
and the flexible nostrils
passion.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page395" id="page395"></a>395</span></p>

<p>A great dispute over realism usually took the place of dessert at meal-times.
Courbet never allowed himself to be drawn into controversy. He
threw his opinion bluntly out, and when he was opposed cut the conversation
short in an exceedingly forcible manner. It was another murder of the
innocents when he spoke of the celebrities of his time. He designated
historical painting as nonsense, style as humbug, and blew away all ideals,
declaring that it was the greatest impudence to wish to paint things which
one has never seen, and of the appearance of which one cannot have the
faintest conception. Fancy was rubbish, and reality the one true muse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our century,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;will not recover from the fever of imitation
by which it has been laid low. Phidias and Raphael have hooked themselves
on to us. The galleries should remain closed for twenty years, so that the
moderns might at last begin to see with their own eyes. For what can the
old masters offer us? It is only Ribera, Zurbaran, and Velasquez that I
admire; Ostade and Craesbeeck also allure me; and for Holbein, I feel
veneration. As for M. Raphael, there is no doubt that he has painted some
interesting portraits, but I cannot find any ideas in him. And the artistic
kin, the heirs, or more properly the slaves of this great man, are really preceptors
of the lowest art. What do they teach us? Nothing. A good
picture will never come from their <i>École des Beaux-Arts</i>. The most precious
thing is the originality, the independence of an artist. Schools have no right
to exist; there are only painters. Independently of system and without
attaching myself to any party, I have studied the art of the old masters and
of the more modern. I have tried to imitate the one as little as I have tried
to copy the other, but out of the total knowledge of tradition I have wished
to draw a firm and independent sense of my own individuality. My object
was by gaining knowledge to gain in ability; to have the power of expressing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page396" id="page396"></a>396</span>
the ideas, the manners, and the aspect of our epoch according to an appreciation
of my own, not merely to be a painter, but a man also&mdash;in a word, to
practise living art is the compass of my design. I am not only a socialist,
but also a democrat and a republican&mdash;that is to say, a supporter of every
revolution; and moreover, a sheer realist, which means a loyal adherent
to the <i>vérité vraie</i>. But the principle of realism is the negation of the ideal.
And following all that comes from this negation of the ideal, I shall arrive at
the emancipation of the individual, and, finally, at democracy. Realism,
in its essence, is democratic art. It can only exist by the representation of
things which the artist can see and handle. For painting is an entirely
physical language, and an abstract, invisible, non-existent object does not come
within its province. The grand painting which we have stands in contradiction
with our social conditions, and ecclesiastical painting in contradiction
with the spirit of the century. It is nonsensical for painters of more or less
talent to dish up themes in which they have no belief, themes which could
only have flourished in some epoch other than our own. Better paint railway
stations with views of the places through which one travels, with likenesses
of great men through whose birthplace one passes, with engine-houses, mines,
and manufactories; for these are the saints and miracles of the nineteenth
century.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These doctrines fundamentally tallied with those which the Neapolitan
and Spanish naturalists vindicated in the seventeenth century against the
eclectics. For men like Poussin, Leseur, and Sassoferato, Raphael was &ldquo;an
angel and not a man,&rdquo; and the Vatican &ldquo;the academy of painters.&rdquo; But
Velasquez when he came to Rome found it wearisome. &ldquo;What do you say
of our Raphael? Do you not think him best of all, now that you have seen
everything that is fair and beautiful in Italy?&rdquo; Don Diego inclined his
head ceremoniously, and observed: &ldquo;To confess the truth, for I like to be
candid and open, I must acknowledge that I do not care about Raphael at all.&rdquo;
There are reported utterances of Caravaggio which correspond almost word
for word with those of Courbet. He, too, declaimed against the antique
and Raphael, in whose shadow he saw so many shallow imitators sitting at
their ease, and he declared, in a spirit of sharp opposition, that the objects
of daily life were the only true teachers. He would owe all to nature and
nothing to art. He held painting without the model to be absurd. So long
as the model was out of sight, his hands and his spirit were idle. Moreover,
he called himself a democratic painter, who brought the fourth estate into
honour; he &ldquo;would rather be the first of vulgar painters than second amongst
the superfine.&rdquo; And just as these naturalists in the seventeenth century
were treated by the academical artists as rhyparographists, Courbet&rsquo;s programme
did not on the whole facilitate his acceptance in formal exhibitions
as he desired that it should. A play must be acted, a manuscript printed, and
a picture viewed. So Courbet had no desire to remain an outsider. When
the picture committee of the World Exhibition of 1855 gave his pictures an
unfavourable position, he withdrew them and offered them to public inspection
separately in a wooden hut in the vicinity of the Pont de Jena, just at
the entry of the exhibition. Upon the hut was written in big letters:
REALISM&mdash;G. COURBET. And in the interior the theories which he had
urged hitherto by his tongue and his pen, at the tavern and in his pamphlets,
were demonstrated by thirty-eight large pictures, which elucidate his whole
artistic development.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lot&rsquo;s Daughters&rdquo; and &ldquo;Love in the Country&rdquo; were followed in 1844 by
the portrait of himself and the picture of his dog, in 1845 by &ldquo;A Guitarrero,&rdquo;
in 1846 by the &ldquo;Portrait of M. M&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; and in 1847 by &ldquo;The Walpurgisnacht&rdquo;;
all works in which he was still groping his way. &ldquo;The Sleeping
Bathers,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Violoncello Player,&rdquo; and a landscape from his native province,
belonging to the year 1848, made a nearer approach to his realistic aim,
and with the date 1849 there are seven portraits, landscapes, and pictures
from popular national life: &ldquo;The Painter,&rdquo; &ldquo;M. H. T&mdash;&mdash; looking over
Engravings,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Vintage in Ornans below the Roche du Mont,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Valley of the Bue seen from the Roche du Mont,&rdquo; &ldquo;View of the Château of
Saint-Denis,&rdquo; &ldquo;Evening in the Village of Scey-en-Varay,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Peasants
returning from Mass near Flagey.&rdquo; All these works had passed the doors of
the Salon without demur.</p>

<p>The first picture which brought about a collision of opinion was &ldquo;A Fire
in Paris,&rdquo; and, according to the account given by contemporaries, it must
have been one of his finest works. Firemen, soldiers, artisans in jacket and
blouse, were exerting themselves, according to Paul d&rsquo;Abrest who describes the
picture, around a burning house; even women helped in the work of rescue,
and formed part of the chain handing buckets from the pump. Opposite
stood a group of young dandies with girls upon their arms looking inactively
upon the scene. An artillery captain, who was amongst Courbet&rsquo;s acquaintances,
had through several nights sounded the alarm for his men and exercised
them on the scaffolding of a wall, so that the painter could make his studies.
Courbet transferred his studio to the barracks and made sketches by torch-light.
But he had reckoned without the police; scarcely was the picture
finished before it was seized, as the Government recognised in it, for reasons
which did not appear, &ldquo;an incitement to the people of the town.&rdquo; This
was after the <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> of 1851.</p>

<p>So Courbet&rsquo;s manifesto was not &ldquo;The Fire in Paris.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Stone-breakers,&rdquo;
two men in the dress of artisans, in a plain evening landscape,
occupied once more the first place in the exhibition of 1855, having already
made the effect, amongst its classical surroundings in the Salon of 1851, of a
rough, true, and honest word, spoken amid elaborate society phrases. There
was also to be seen &ldquo;Afternoon at Ornans,&rdquo;&mdash;a gathering of humble folk
sitting after meal-time at a table laid out in a rustic kitchen. A picture
which became celebrated under the title of &ldquo;Bonjour, M. Courbet&rdquo; dealt
with a scene from Courbet&rsquo;s native town. Courbet, just arrived, is alighting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page400" id="page400"></a>400</span>
from a carriage in his travelling costume, looking composedly about him
with a pipe in his mouth. A respectable prosperous gentleman, accompanied
by a servant in livery, who is carrying his overcoat, is stretching out his hand
to him. This gentleman is M. Bryas, the Mæcenas of Ornans, who for long
was Courbet&rsquo;s only patron, and who had a whim for having his portrait taken
by forty Parisian painters in order to learn the &ldquo;manners&rdquo; of the various
artists. And there was further to be seen the &ldquo;Demoiselles de Village&rdquo; of
1852, three country beauties giving a piece of cake to a peasant-girl. Finally,
as masterpieces, there were &ldquo;The Funeral at Ornans,&rdquo; which now hangs in
the Louvre, and that great canvas, designated in the catalogue as &ldquo;a true
allegory,&rdquo; &ldquo;My Studio after Seven Years of Artistic Life,&rdquo; the master himself
painting a landscape. Behind him is a nude model, and in front of him a
beggar-woman with her child. Around are portrait figures of his friends,
and the heroes of his pictures, a poacher, a parson, a sexton, labourers, and
artisans.</p>

<p>The exhibition was, at all events, a success with young painters, and
Courbet set up a teaching studio, at the opening of which he again issued a
kind of manifesto in the <i>Courrier du Dimanche</i>. &ldquo;Beauty,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;lies
in nature, and it is to be met with under the most various forms. As soon as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page401" id="page401"></a>401</span>
it is found it belongs to art, or rather to the artist who discovers it. But the
painter has no right to add to this expression of nature, to alter the form of
it and thereby weaken it. The beauty offered by nature stands high above
all artistic convention. That is the basis of my views of art.&rdquo; It is said
that his first model was an ox. When his pupils wanted another, Courbet
said: &ldquo;Very well, gentlemen, next time let us study a courtier.&rdquo; The break-up
of the school is supposed to have taken place when one day the ox ran
away and was not to be recaptured.</p>

<p>Courbet did not trouble himself over such ridicule, but painted quietly
on, the many-sidedness of his talent soon giving him a firm seat in every
saddle. After the scandal of the separate exhibition of 1855 he was excluded
from the Salon until 1861, and during this time exhibited in Paris and Besançon
upon his own account. &ldquo;The Funeral at Ornans&rdquo; was followed by &ldquo;The
Return from Market,&rdquo; a party of peasants on the high-road, and in 1860
by &ldquo;The Return from the Conference,&rdquo; in which a number of French country
priests have celebrated their meeting with a hearty lunch and set out on the
way back in a condition which is far too jovial. In 1861, when the gates of the
Champs Elysées were thrown open to him once more, he received the medal
for his &ldquo;Battle of the Stags,&rdquo; and regularly contributed to the Salon until
1870. In these years he attempted pictures with many figures less frequently,
and painted by preference hunting and animal pieces, landscapes, and the
nude figures of women. &ldquo;The Woman with the Parrot,&rdquo; a female figure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page402" id="page402"></a>402</span>
mantled with long hair, lying undressed amid the cushions of a couch playing
with her gaudily feathered favourite, &ldquo;The Fox Hunt,&rdquo; a coast scene in
Provence, the portrait of Proudhon and his family, &ldquo;The Valley of the Puits-Noir,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Roche Pagnan,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Roe Hunt,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Charity of a Beggar,&rdquo;
the picture of women bathing in the gloom of the forest, and &ldquo;The Wave,&rdquo;
afterwards acquired by the Luxembourg, belong to his principal works in the
sixties.</p>

<p>These works gradually made him so well known that after 1866 his pictures
came to have a considerable sale. The critics began to take him seriously.
Castagnary made his début in the <i>Siècle</i> with a study of Courbet; Champfleury,
the apostle of literary realism, devoted to him a whole series of
<i>feuilletons</i> in the <i>Messager de l&rsquo;Assemblée</i>, and from his intercourse with him
Proudhon derived the fundamental principles of his book on Realism. The
son of Franche-Comté triumphed, and there was a beam in his laughing eyes,
always like those of a deer. His talent began more and more to unfold its
wings in the sun of success, and his power of production seemed inexhaustible.
When the custom arose of
publishing in the Parisian
papers accounts of the budget
of painters, he took care to
communicate that in six
months he had made a
hundred and twenty-three
thousand francs. Incessantly
busy, he had in his hand at
one moment the brush and
at another the chisel. And
when he gave another special
exhibition of his works in
1867, at the time of the great
World Exhibition&mdash;he had a
mania for wooden booths&mdash;he
was able to put on view no less
than a hundred and thirty-two
pictures in addition to
numerous pieces of sculpture.
In 1869 the committee
of the Munich Exhibition set
apart a whole room for his
works. With a self-satisfied
smile he put on the Order of
Michael, and was the hero
of the day whom all eyes
followed upon the boulevards.</p>

<p>The nature of the bullfighter was developed in him more strongly than
before, and he stretched his powerful limbs, prepared to do battle against all
existing opinions. Naturally the events of the following years found no idle
spectator in such a firebrand as Courbet; and accordingly he rushed into
those follies which embittered the evening of his life. The <i>maître peintre
d&rsquo;Ornans</i> became Courbet <i>le colonnard</i>. First came the sensational protest
with which he returned to the Emperor Napoleon the Order of the Legion of
Honour. Four weeks after Courbet had plunged into this affair the war
broke out. Eight weeks later came Sedan and the proclamation of the Republic,
and shortly afterwards the siege of Paris and the insurrection. On
4th September 1870 the Provisional Government appointed him Director
of the Fine Arts. Afterwards he became a member of the Commune, and
dominated everywhere, with the <i>brûle-gueule</i> in his mouth, by the power of his
voice; and France has to thank him for the rescue of a large number of her
most famous treasures of art. He had the rich collections of Thiers placed
in the Louvre, to protect them from the rough and ready violence of the
populace. But to save the Luxembourg he sacrificed the column of the
Vendôme. When the Commune fell, however, Courbet alone was held responsible
for the destruction of the column. He was brought before the court-martial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page404" id="page404"></a>404</span>
of Versailles, and, although Thiers undertook his defence, he was
condemned to six months&rsquo; imprisonment. Having undergone this punishment
he received his freedom once more, but the artist had still to suffer a
mortal blow. The pictures which he had destined for the Salon of 1873 were
rejected by the committee, because Courbet was held morally unworthy to
take part in the exhibition.</p>

<p>Soon after this an action was brought against him, on the initiative of
certain reactionary papers, for the payment of damages connected with the
overthrow of the Vendôme column, and the painter lost his case. For the
recovery of these damages, which were assessed at three hundred and thirty-four
thousand francs, the Government brought to the hammer his furniture
and the pictures that were in his studio, at a compulsory sale at the Hôtel
Drouot, where they fetched the absurdly trifling figure of twelve thousand one
hundred and eighteen francs fifty centimes. The loss of his case drove him
from France to Switzerland. He gave the town of Vevay, where he settled,
a bust of Helvetia, as a mark of his gratitude for the hospitality it had extended
towards him. But the artist was crushed in him. &ldquo;They have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page405" id="page405"></a>405</span>
killed me,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I feel that I shall never do anything good again.&rdquo;
And thus the jovial, laughing Courbet, that honoured leader of a brilliant
pleiad of disciples, the friend and companion of Corot, Decamps, Gustave
Planché, Baudelaire, Théophile Gautier, Silvestre, Proudhon, and Champfleury;
the enthusiastic patriot and idol of the fickle Parisians, passed his
last years in melancholy solitude, forgotten by his adherents and scorned by
his adversaries. He was attacked by a disease of the liver, and privation,
disillusionment, and depression came all at once. Moreover, the French
Government began again to make claims for indemnification. His heart
broke in a prolonged mortal struggle. Shortly before his death he said to a
friend: &ldquo;What am I to live upon, and how am I to pay for the column? I
have saved Thiers more than a million francs, and the State more than ten
millions, and now they are at my heels&mdash;they are baiting me to death. I can
do no more. To work one must have peace of spirit, and I am a ruined
man.&rdquo; And Champfleury writes, referring to the last visit which he
paid to the dying exile on 19th December 1877: &ldquo;His beard and hair
were white, and all that remained of the handsome, all-powerful Courbet
whom I had known was that notable Assyrian profile, which he raised to
the snow of the Alps, as I sat beside him and saw it for the last time. The
sight of such pain and misery as this premature wreck of the whole man was
overwhelming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Lake of Geneva, over which he looked from his window in Vevay, was
the subject of the last picture that he painted in Switzerland. Far from home
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page406" id="page406"></a>406</span>
and amid indifferent strangers he closed his eyes, which had once been
so brilliant, in endless grief of spirit. The apostle of Realism died of
a broken heart, the herculean son of Franche-Comté could not suffer
disillusionment. Courbet passed away, more or less forgotten, upon New
Year&rsquo;s Eve in 1877, in that chilly hour of morning when the lake which
he had learnt to love trembles beneath the first beams of the sun. It was
only in Belgium, where he had often stayed and where his influence
was considerable, that the intelligence of his death woke a painful echo.
In Paris it met with no word of sympathy. Courbetism was extinguished;
as impressionists and independents his adherents had gathered round
new flags. Zola has done him honour in <i>L&rsquo;&OElig;uvre</i> in the person of old
Bongrand, that half-perished veteran who is only mentioned now and then
with veneration.</p>

<p>And the course of development has indeed been so rapid since Courbet&rsquo;s
appearance that in these days one almost fails to understand, apart from
historical reasons, the grounds which in 1855 made his separate exhibition
of his works an event of epoch-making importance. It was not Cham alone
who at that time devoted a large cartoon to Courbet, as he did in &ldquo;The
Opening of Courbet&rsquo;s Studio and Concentrated Realism.&rdquo; All the comic
journals of Paris were as much
occupied with him as with
the crinoline, the noiseless
pavement, the new tramways,
or the balloon. Haussard,
the principal representative
of criticism, in discussing
&ldquo;The Funeral at Ornans,&rdquo;
spoke of &ldquo;these burlesque
masks with their fuddled red
noses, this village priest who
seems to be a tippler, and the
harlequin of a veteran who is
putting on a hat which is too
big for him.&rdquo; All this, he
continued, suggested a masquerade
funeral, six metres
long, in which there was more
to laugh at than to weep
over. Even Paul Mantz declared
that the most extravagant
fancy could not
descend to such a degree of
jejune triviality and repulsive
hideousness. In a <i>revue d&rsquo;année</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page407" id="page407"></a>407</span>
produced at the Odéon, the authors, Philoxène Hoyer and Théodore de

<p>So it went on through the sixties also. When the Empress Eugénie
passed through the exhibition on the opening day of the Salon of 1866, with
an elegant walking-stick in her hand, she was so indignant at Courbet&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Naked Women&rdquo; that the picture had to be immediately removed. In the
beginning of the seventies, when he exhibited in Germany, a few young
Munich painters recognised in his pictures something like the cry of a conscience.
But otherwise &ldquo;artists and laymen shook their heads, not knowing
what to make of them. Some smiled and went indifferently on, while others
were indignant in their condemnation of this degradation of art.&rdquo; For
&ldquo;Courbet went to the lowest depths of society, and took his themes from a
class where man really ceases to be man, and the image of God prolongs a
miserable existence as a moving mass of flesh. Living bodies with dead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page408" id="page408"></a>408</span>
souls, which exist only for the sake of their animal needs; in one place sunk
in misery and wretchedness, and in another having never risen from their
brutal savagery&mdash;that is the society from which Courbet chooses his motives,
to gloss over the debility of his imagination and his want of any kind of training.
Had he possessed the talent for composition, then perhaps his lifeless
technique would have become interesting; as it is he offers a merely arbitrary
succession of figures in which coherence is entirely wanting.&rdquo; In &ldquo;The
Stone-breakers&rdquo; it was an offence that he should have treated such &ldquo;an
excessively commonplace subject&rdquo; at all as mere artisans in ragged and
dirty clothes. And by &ldquo;The Funeral at Ornans&rdquo; it was said that he meant
to sneer at the religious ceremony, since the picture had a defiant and directly
brutal vulgarity. The painter was alleged to have taken pains to expose
the repulsive, ludicrous, and grotesque elements in the members of the funeral
party, and to have softened no feature which could excite an unseasonable
merriment. In the &ldquo;Demoiselles de Village&rdquo; the design had been to contrast
the stilted, provincial nature of these village misses with the healthy simplicity
of a peasant child. In the picture, painted in 1857, of the two grisettes
lying in the grass on the bank of the Seine he had &ldquo;intentionally placed the
girls in the most unrefined attitudes, that they might appear as trivial as
possible.&rdquo; And umbrage was taken at his two naked wrestlers because he
&ldquo;had not painted wrestlers more or less like those of classic times, but the
persons who exhibit the strength of their herculean frames at the Hippodrome,&rdquo;
and therefore given &ldquo;the most vulgar rendering of nudity that was
at all possible.&rdquo; And in his naked women it was said that this love of ugly
and brutal forms became actually base.</p>

<p>All these judgments are characteristic symptoms of the same sort of taste
which rose in the seventeenth century against Caravaggio. Even his principal
work, the altar-piece to St. Matthew, which now hangs in the Berlin
Museum, excited so much indignation that it had to be removed from the
Church of St. Luigi dei Francesi in Rome. Annibale Carracci has a scornful
caricature in which the Neapolitan master appears as a hairy savage, with a
dwarf at his side and two apes upon his knees, and, in this fashion, intended
to brand the hideousness of his rival&rsquo;s art and his ape-like imitation of misshapen
nature. Francesco Albani called him the &ldquo;Antichrist of Painting,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;a ruination to art.&rdquo; And Baglione adds: &ldquo;Now a number of young
men sit down to copy a head after nature; they study neither the foundations
of drawing, nor concern themselves about the more profound conditions of art,
merely contenting themselves with a crude reproduction of nature, and therefore
they do not even know how to group two figures appropriately, nor to
bring any theme into an artistic composition. No one any longer visits the
temples of art, but every one finds his masters and his models for a servile
imitation of nature in the streets and open places.&rdquo; The nineteenth century
formed a different estimate of Caravaggio. In opposing his fortune-telling
gipsies, his tipplers, gamblers, musicians, and dicing mercenaries to the noble
figures of the academical artists, with their generalised and carefully balanced
forms, their trivial, nugatory countenances, and their jejune colouring, he
accomplished the legitimate and necessary reaction against a shallow and
empty idealistic mannerism. No one is grateful to the eclectic artists for the
learned efforts which it cost them to paint so tediously: in Caravaggio there is the
fascination of a strong personality and a virile emphasis in form, colour, and light.
The Carracci and Albani were the issue of their predecessors; Caravaggio is
honoured as a fearless pioneer who opened a new chapter in the history of art.</p>

<p>Courbet met with a similar fate.</p>

<p>If one approaches him after reading the criticisms of his pictures already
cited, a great disillusionment is inevitable. Having imagined a grotesque
monster, one finds to one&rsquo;s astonishment that there is not the slightest
occasion either for indignation or laughter in the presence of these powerful,
sincere, and energetic pictures. One has expected caricatures and a repulsive
hideousness, and one finds a broad and masterly style of painting. The heads
are real without being vulgar, and the flesh firm and soft and throbbing with
powerful life. Courbet is a personality. He began by imitating the Flemish
painters and the Neapolitans. But far more did he feel himself attracted by
the actual world, by massive women and strong men, and wide fertile fields
smelling of rich, rank earth. As a healthy and sensuously vigorous man he
felt a voluptuous satisfaction in clasping actual nature in his herculean arms.
Of course, by the side of his admirable pictures there are others which are
heavy and uncouth. But if one is honest one paints according to one&rsquo;s inherent
nature, as old Navez, the pupil of David, was in the habit of saying.
Courbet was honest, and he was also a somewhat unwieldy being, and therefore
his painting too has something bluff and cumbrous. But where in all
French art is there such a sound painter, so sure of his effects and with such
a large bravura, a <i>maître peintre</i> who was so many-sided, extending his
dominion as much over figure-painting as landscape, over the nude as over
<i>nature morte</i>? There is no artist so many of whose pictures may be seen
together without surfeit, for he is novel in almost every work. He has
painted not a few pictures of which it may be said that each one is <i>sui generis</i>,
and on the variations of which elsewhere entire reputations might have been
founded. With the exception of Millet, no one had observed man and nature
with such sincere and open eyes. With the great realists of the past Courbet
shares the characteristic of being everywhere and exclusively a portrait
painter. A pair of stone-breakers, kneeling as they do in his picture, with
their faces protected by wire-masks, were figures which every one saw working
at the street corner, and Courbet represented the scene as faithfully as he
could, as sincerely and positively as was at all possible. &ldquo;Afternoon in
Ornans&rdquo; is a pleasant picture, in which he took up again the good tradition
of Lenain. And in &ldquo;The Funeral at Ornans&rdquo; he has painted exactly the
manner in which such ceremonies take place in the country. The peasants
and dignitaries of a little country town&mdash;portrait figures such as the masters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page412" id="page412"></a>412</span>
of the fifteenth century brought into their religious pictures&mdash;have followed
the funeral train, and behave themselves at the grave just as peasants would.
They make no impassioned gesticulations, and form themselves into no fine
groups, but stand there like true rustics, sturdy and indifferent. They are
men of flesh and blood, they are like the people of real life, and they have been
subjected to no alteration: on the one side are the women tearfully affected
by the words of the preacher, on the other are the men bored by the ceremony
or discussing their own affairs. In the &ldquo;Demoiselles de Village&rdquo; he gives a
portrait of his own sisters, as they went to a dance of a Sunday afternoon.
The &ldquo;Girls lying on the Bank of the Seine&rdquo; are grisettes of 1850, such as
Gavarni often drew; they are both dressed in doubtful taste, one asleep, the
other lost in a vacant reverie. His naked women make a very tame effect
compared with the colossal masses of human flesh in that cascade of nude
women of the plumpest description who in Rubens&rsquo; &ldquo;Last Judgment&rdquo;
plunge in confusion into hell, like fish poured out from a bucket. But they
are amongst the best nude female figures which have been created in the
nineteenth century. Courbet was a painter of the family of Rubens and
Jordaens. He had the preference shown by the old Flemish artists for
healthy, plump, soft flesh, for fair, fat, and forty, the three F&rsquo;s of feminine
beauty, and in his works he gave the academicians a lesson well worth taking
to heart; he showed them that it was possible to attain a powerful effect,
and even grace itself, by strict fidelity to the forms of reality.</p>

<p>His portraits&mdash;and he had the advantage of painting Berlioz and Baudelaire,
Champfleury and Proudhon&mdash;are possibly not of conspicuous eminence
as likenesses. As Caravaggio, according to Bellori, &ldquo;had only spirit, eyes
and diligence for flesh-tints, skin, blood, and the natural surface of objects,&rdquo; a
head was merely a <i>morceau</i> like anything else for Courbet too, and not the
central point of a thinking and sensitive being. The physical man, Taine&rsquo;s
human animal, was more important in his eyes than the psychical. He
painted the epidermis without giving much suggestion of what was beneath.
But he painted this surface in such a broad and impressive manner that the
pictures are interesting as pictorial masterpieces if not as analyses of character.</p>

<p>To these his landscapes and animal pieces must be added as the works on
which his talent displayed itself in the greatest purity and most inherent vigour:
&ldquo;The Battle of the Stags,&rdquo; that most admirable picture &ldquo;The Hind on the
Snow,&rdquo; &ldquo;Deer in Covert,&rdquo; views of the moss-grown rocks and sunlit woods
of Ornans and the green valleys
of the Franche-Comté. He had
the special secret of painting with
a beautiful tone and a broad, sure
stroke dead plumage and hunting-gear,
the bristling hide of wild-boars,
and the more delicate coat
of deer and of dogs. As a landscape
painter he does not belong
to the family of Corot and Dupré.
His landscapes are green no
doubt, but they have limitations;
the leaves hang motionless on the
branches, undisturbed by a breath
of wind. Courbet has forgotten
the most important thing, the air.
Whatever the time of the year or
the day may be, winter or summer,
evening or morning, he sees nothing
but the form of things, regarding
the sun as a machine which
has no other purpose than to mark
the relief of objects by light and
shade. Moreover, the lyricism of
the Fontainebleau painters was
not in him. He paints without
reverie, and knows nothing of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page414" id="page414"></a>414</span>
that tender faltering of the landscape painter in which the poet awakes,
but has merely the equanimity of a good and sure worker. In regard to
nature, he has the sentiments of a peasant who tills his land, is never
elegiac or bucolic, and would be most indignant if a nymph were to
tread on the furrows of his fields. He paints with a pipe in his mouth
and a spade in his hand, the plain and the hills, potatoes and cabbages,
rich turf and slimy rushes, oxen with steaming nostrils heavily ploughing
the clods, cows lying down and breathing at ease the damp air of the
meadows drenched with rain. He delights in fertile patches of country,
and in the healthy odour of the cow-house. A material heaviness and a
prosaic sincerity are stamped upon all. But his painting has a solidity
delightful to the eye. It is inspiriting to meet a man who has such a resolute
and simple love of nature, and can interpret her afresh in powerful and sound
colour without racking his brains. His attachment to the spot of earth where
he was born is a leading characteristic of his art. He borrowed from Ornans
the motives of his most successful creations, and was always glad to return to
his parents&rsquo; house. The patriotism of the church-spire, provincialism, and
a touching and vivid sense of home are peculiar to all his landscapes. But
in his sea-pieces, to which he
was incited by a residence in
Trouville in the summer of 1865,
he has opened an altogether new
province to French art. <i>Eugène
Le Poittevin</i>, who exhibited a
good deal in Berlin in the forties,
and therefore became very well
known in Germany, cannot count
as a painter. <i>Théodore Gudin</i>,
whose signature is likewise highly
valued in the market, was a
frigid and rough-and-ready
scenical painter. His little sea-pieces
have a professional manner,
and the large naval battles
and fires at sea which he executed
by the commission of
Louis Philippe for the Museum
of Versailles are frigid, pompous,
and spectacular sea-pieces parallel
with Vernet&rsquo;s battle-pieces.
<i>Ziem</i>, who gave up his time to
Venice and the Adriatic, is the
progenitor of Eduard Hildebrandt.
His water and sky take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page415" id="page415"></a>415</span>
all the colours of the prism, and the
objects grouped between these luminous
elements, houses, ships, and
men, equally receive a share of these
flattering and iridescent tones. This
gives something seductive and dazzling
to his sketches, until it is at last
perceived that he has only painted
one picture, repeating it mechanically
in all dimensions. Courbet was the
first French painter of sea-pieces who
had a feeling for the sombre majesty
of the sea. The ocean of Gudin and
Ziem inspires neither wonder nor
veneration; that of Courbet does
both. His very quietude is expressive
of majesty; his peace is imposing,
his smile grave; and his caress
is not without a menace.</p>

<p>Courbet has positively realised the
programme which he issued in that
pamphlet of 1855. When he began
his activity, eclectic idealism had
overgrown the tree of art. But Courbet stripped off the parasitic vegetation to
reach the firm and serviceable timber. And having once grasped it he showed
the muscles of an athlete in making its power felt. Something of the old
Flemish sturdiness lived once more in his bold creations. If he and Delacroix
were united, the result would be Rubens. Delacroix had the fervour and
passionate tamelessness, while Courbet contributed the Flemish weight.
Each made use of blood, purple, thrones, and Golgothas in composing the
dramas they had imagined. The latter pictured creation with the absolutism
of complete objectivity. Delacroix rose on the horizon like a brilliant meteor
catching flame from the light of vanished suns; he reflected their radiance,
had almost their magnitude, and followed the same course amid the same
coruscation and blaze of light. Courbet stands firm and steady upon the earth.
The former had the second sight known to visionaries, the latter opened his
eyes to the world that can be felt and handled. Neurotic and distempered,
Delacroix worked feverishly. As a sound, full-blooded being Courbet painted,
as a man drinks, digests, and talks, with an activity that knows no exertion,
a force that knows no weariness. Delacroix was a small, weakly man, and
his whole power rested in his huge head. That of Courbet, as in animals of
beauty and power, was dispersed through his whole frame; his big arms and
athletic hands render the same service to his art as his eyes and his brain.
And as, like all sincere artists, he rendered himself, he was the creator of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page416" id="page416"></a>416</span>
art which has an irrepressible health and overflows with an exuberant opulence.
His pictures brought a savour of the butcher&rsquo;s shop into French painting,
which had become anæmic. He delighted in plump shoulders and sinewy
necks, broad breasts heaving over the corset, the glow of the skin dripping
with warm drops of water in the bath, the hide of deer and the coat of hares,
the iridescent shining of carp and cod-fish. Delacroix, all brain, caught fire
from his inward visions; Courbet, all eye and maw, with the sensuousness
of an epicure and the satisfaction of a <i>gourmet</i>, gloats over the shining vision
of things which can be devoured&mdash;a Gargantua with a monstrous appetite,
he buried himself in the navel of the generous earth. Plants, fruit, and
vegetables take voluptuous life beneath his brush. He triumphs when he
has to paint a <i>déjeuner</i> with oysters, lemons, turkeys, fish, and pheasants.
His mouth waters when he heaps into a picture of still-life all manner of
delicious eatables. The only drama that he has painted is &ldquo;The Battle of
the Stags,&rdquo; and this will
end in brown sauce amid
a cheerful clatter of
knives and forks.</p>

<p>Even as a landscape
painter he is luxurious
and phlegmatic. In his
pictures the earth is a
corpulent nurse, the trees
fine and well-fed children,
and all nature healthy
and contented. His art
is like a powerful body
fed with rich nourishment.
In such organisms
the capacity for enthusiasm
and delicacy of sentiment
are too easily sacrificed
to their physical
satisfaction, but their
robust health ensures
them the longer life.
Here is neither the routine
and external technique
and the correct,
academic articulation of
form belonging to mannerists,
nor the strained,
neurotic, sickly refinement
of the decadents,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page417" id="page417"></a>417</span>
but the powerful utterance
of inborn, instinctive talent,
and the strong cries of
nature which rise out of it
will be understood at all
times, even the most distant.
It is hardly necessary to add
that the appearance of a
genius of this kind was
fraught with untold consequences
to the further development
of French painting.</p>

<p>What is held beautiful in
nature must likewise be beautiful
in pictorial art when
it is faithfully represented,
and nature is beautiful
everywhere. In announcing
this and demonstrating it
in pictures of life-size, Courbet
won for art all the wide
dominion of modern life
which had hitherto been so
studiously avoided&mdash;the dominion
in which it had to
revel if it was to learn to see with its own eyes. One fragment of reality
after another would then be drawn into the sphere of representation, and no
longer in the form of laboriously composed <i>genre</i> pictures, but after the
fashion of really pictorial works of art.</p>

<p>What Millet had done for the peasant, and Courbet for the artisan, <i>Alfred
Stevens</i> did for &ldquo;society&rdquo;: he discovered the <i>Parisienne</i>. Until 1850 the
graceful life of the refined classes, which Gavarni, Marcellin, and Cham had
so admirably drawn, found no adequate representation in the province of
painting. The <i>Parisienne</i>, who is so <i>chic</i> and piquant, and can hate and kiss
with such fervour, fascinated every one, but Grecian profile was a matter of
prescription. <i>Auguste Toulmouche</i> painted little women in fashionable toilette,
but less from any taste he had for the graceful vision than from delight in
<i>genre</i> painting. They were forced to find forbidden books in the library, to
resist worldly marriages, or behave in some such interesting fashion, to enter
into the kingdom of art. It was reserved for a foreigner to reveal this world
of beauty, <i>chic</i>, and grace.</p>

<p>Alfred Stevens was a child of Brussels. He was born in the land of Flemish
matrons on 11th May 1828, and was the second of three children. Joseph,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page418" id="page418"></a>418</span>
the elder brother, became afterwards the celebrated painter of animals;
Arthur, the youngest, became an art-critic and a picture-dealer; he was one
of the first who brought home to the public comprehension the noble art of
Rousseau, Corot, and Millet. Stevens&rsquo; father fought as an officer in the great
army at the battle of Waterloo, and is said to have been an accomplished
critic. Some of the ablest sketches of Delacroix, Devéria, Charlet, and
Roqueplan found their way into his charming home. Roqueplan, who often
came to Brussels, took the younger Stevens with him to his Parisian studio.
He was a tall, graceful young man, who, with his vigorous upright carriage,
his finely chiselled features, and his dandified moustache, looked like an
officer of dragoons or cuirassiers. He was a pleasure-loving man of the
world, and was soon the lion of Parisian drawing-rooms. The grace of modern
life in great cities became the domain of his art. The <i>Parisienne</i>, whom his
French fellow-artists passed by without heed, was a strange, interesting
phenomenon to him, who was a foreigner&mdash;an exotic and exquisitely artistic
<i>bibelot</i>, which he looked upon with eyes as enraptured as those with which
Decamps had looked upon
the East.</p>

<p>His very first picture, exhibited
in 1855, was called
&ldquo;At Home.&rdquo; A charming
little woman is warming her
feet at the fire; she has returned
from visiting a friend,
and it has been raining or
snowing outside. Her delicate
hands are frozen in spite
of her muff, her cheeks have
been reddened by the wind,
and she has a pleasant sense
of comfort as her rosy lips
breathe the warm air of the
room. From the time of this
picture women took possession
of Stevens&rsquo; easel. His
way was prescribed for him,
and he never left it. Robert
Fleury, the president of the
judging committee in the
Salon, said to him: &ldquo;You
are a good painter, but alter
your subjects; you are stifling
in a sphere which is too
small; how wide and grand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page419" id="page419"></a>419</span>
is that of the past!&rdquo; Whereon
Stevens is said to have showed
him a volume of photographs
from Velasquez. &ldquo;Look here at
Velasquez,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This man
never represented anything but
what he had before his eyes&mdash;people
in the Spanish dress of the
seventeenth century. And as
the justification of my <i>genre</i> may
be found in this Spanish painter,
it may be found also in Rubens,
Raphael, Van Dyck, and all the
great artists. All these masters
of the past derived their strength
and the secret of their endurance
from the faithful reproduction of
what they had themselves seen:
it gives their pictures a real
historical as well as an artistic
value. One can only render
successfully what one has felt
sincerely and seen vividly before
one&rsquo;s eyes in flesh and blood.&rdquo;
In these sentences he is at one
with Courbet, and by not allowing
himself to be led astray into
doing sacrifice to the idols of historical painting he continues to live as the
historical painter of the <i>Parisienne</i>.</p>

<p>In his whole work he sounds a pæan to the delicate and all-powerful mistress
of the world, and it is significant that it was through woman that art joined
issue with the interests of the present. Millet, the first who conquered a province
of modern life, was at the same time the first great painter of women
in the century. Stevens shows the other side of the medal. In Millet woman
was a product of nature; in Stevens she is the product of modern civilisation.
The woman of Millet lives a large animal life, in the sweat of her brow, bowed
to the earth. She is the primæval mother who works, bears children, and
gives them nourishment. She stands in the field like a caryatid, like a symbol
of fertile nature. In Stevens woman does not toil and is seldom a mother.
He paints the woman who loves, enjoys, and knows nothing of the great pangs
of child-birth and hunger. The one woman lives beneath the wide, open sky,
<i>dans le grand air</i>; the other is only enveloped in an atmosphere of perfume.
She is ancient Cybele in the pictures of Millet; in those of Stevens the holy
Magdalene of the nineteenth century, to whom much will be forgiven, because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page420" id="page420"></a>420</span>
she has loved much. The
pictures of Stevens represent,
for the first time, the potent
relations of woman to the
century. Whilst most works
of this time are silent concerning
ourselves, his art will
speak of our weaknesses and
our passions. In a period of
archaic painting he upheld the
banner of modernity. On this
account posterity will honour
him as one of the first historians
of the nineteenth century,
and will learn from his pictures
all that Greuze has revealed to
the present generation about
the civilisation of the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p>And perhaps more, for
Stevens never moralised&mdash;he
merely painted. Painter to his
finger tips, like Delacroix, Roqueplan,
and Isabey, he stood
in need of no anecdotic substratum as an adjunct. The key of his pictures was
suggested by no theme of one sort or another, but by his treatment of colour.
The picture was evolved from the first tone he placed upon the canvas, which
was the ground-note of the entire scale. He delighted in a thick pasty handling,
in beautiful hues, and in finely chased detail. And he was as little inclined
to sentimentality as to pictorial novels. Everything is discreet, piquant,
and full of charm. He was a delicate spirit, avoiding tears and laughter.
Subdued joy, melancholy, and everything delicate and reserved are what he
loves; he will have nothing to do with stereotyped arrangement nor supernumerary
figures, but although a single person dominates the stage he never
repeats himself. He has followed woman through all her metamorphoses&mdash;as
mother or in love, weary or excited, proud or humbled, fallen or at the
height of success, in her morning-gown or dressed for visiting or a promenade,
now on the sea-shore, now in the costume of a Japanese, or dallying with her
trinkets as she stands vacantly before the glass. The surroundings invariably
form an accompaniment to the melody. A world of exquisite things is the
environment of the figures. Rich stuffs, charming <i>petit-riens</i> from China
and Japan, the most delicate ivory and lacquer-work, the finest bronzes,
Japanese fire-screens, and great vases with blossoming sprays, fill the boudoir
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page421" id="page421"></a>421</span>
and drawing-room of the <i>Parisienne</i>. In the pictures of Stevens she is the
fairy of a paradise made up of all the most capricious products of art. A
new world was discovered, a painting which was in touch with life; the symphony
of the salon was developed in a delicate style. A tender feminine
perfume, something at once melancholy and sensuous, was exhaled from the
pictures of Stevens, and by this shade of <i>demi-monde haut-goût</i> he won the
great public. They could not rise to Millet and Courbet, and Stevens was
the first who gave general pleasure without paying toll to the vicious
taste for melodramatic, narrative, and humorous <i>genre</i> painting. Even
in the sixties he was appreciated in England, France, Germany, Russia,
and Belgium, and represented in all public and private collections; and
through the wide reception offered to his pictures he contributed much to
create in the public a comprehension for good painting.</p>

<p>In the same way <i>James
Tissot</i> achieved the representation
of the modern woman.
Stevens, a Belgian, painted the
<i>Parisienne</i>; Tissot, a Frenchman,
the Englishwoman. It was
not till they went into foreign
countries that these artists perceived
the grace of what was not
deemed suitable to art at home.
In Paris from the year 1859
Tissot had painted scenes from
the fifteenth century, to which
he was moved by Leys, and he
studied with archæological accuracy
the costume and furniture
of the late Gothic period.
When he migrated to England
in 1871 he gave up the romantic
proclivities of his youth, and
devoted himself to the representation
of fashionable society.
His oil paintings fascinate us
by their delicate feeling for cool
transparent tone values, whilst
his water-colours&mdash;restaurant,
theatre, and ball scenes&mdash;assure
him a place among the pioneers
of modernity.</p>

<p>At first Stevens found no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page422" id="page422"></a>422</span>
successors amongst Parisian painters. A few, indeed, painted interiors in
graceful Paris, but they were only frigid compositions of dresses and furniture,
without a breath of that delicate aroma which exhales from the works
of the Belgian. The portrait painters alone approached that modern grace
which still awaited its historian and poet.</p>

<p>An exceedingly delicate artist, <i>Gustave Ricard</i>, in whose portraits the art
of galleries had a congenial revival, was called the modern Van Dyck in the
sixties. Living nature did not content him; he wished to learn how it was
interpreted by the old masters, and therefore frequented galleries, where he
sought counsel sometimes from the English portrait-painters, sometimes
from Leonardo, Rubens, and Van Dyck. In this way Ricard became a
<i>gourmet</i> of colour, who knew the technique of the old masters as few others
have done, and his works have an attractive golden gallery-tone of great
distinction.</p>

<p>In <i>Charles Chaplin</i> Fragonard was revived. He was the specialist of
languishing flesh and <i>poudre de riz</i>, the refined interpreter of aristocratic
beauty, one on whose palette there might still be found a delicate reflection of
the <i>fêtes galantes</i> of the eighteenth century. In Germany he was principally
known by those dreamy, frail, and sensual maidens, well characterised by the
phrase of the Empress Eugénie. &ldquo;M. Chaplin,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I admire you.
Your pictures are not merely
indecorous, they are more.&rdquo;
But Chaplin had likewise the
other qualities of the <i>rococo</i>
painter. He was a decorative
artist of the first rank, and, like
Fragonard, he carelessly scattered
round him on all sides grace
and beauty, charm and fascination.
In 1857 he decorated the
<i>Salon des Fleurs</i> in the Tuileries,
in 1861-65 the bathroom of the
Empress in the <i>Palais de l&rsquo;Elysée</i>,
and from 1865 a number of
private houses in Paris, Brussels,
and New York; and there is in
all these works a refined <i>haut-goût</i>
of modern Parisian elegance
and fragrant <i>rococo</i> grace. He
revived no nymphs, and made
no pilgrimage to the island of
Cythera; he was more of an
epicurean. But Fragonard&rsquo;s fine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page423" id="page423"></a>423</span>
tones and Fragonard&rsquo;s sensuousness
were peculiar to him. He had a
method of treating the hair, of introducing
little patches, of setting a
dimple in the chin, and painting the
arms and bosom, which had vanished
since the <i>rococo</i> period from the
power of French artists. Rosebuds
and full-blown roses blossom like girls
<i>à la</i> Greuze, and fading beauties, who
are all the more irresistible, are the
elements out of which his refined, indecorous,
and yet fragrant art is constituted.</p>

<p>The great engraver <i>Gaillard</i> brought
Hans Holbein once more into honour.
He was the heir of that method of
painting, the eternal matrix of which
Jan van Eyck left to the world in
unapproachable perfection. His energetic
but conscientiously minute
brush noted every wrinkle of the face,
without doing injury to the total impression by this labour of detail.
Indeed, his pictures are as great in conception and as powerful in characterisation
as they are small in size. Gaillard is a profound physiognomist
who attained the most vivid analysis of character by means of the utmost
precision.</p>

<p><i>Paul Dubois</i> takes us across the Alps; in his portraits he is the same great
quattrocentist that he was from the beginning in his plastic works. His
ground is that of the excellent and subtle period when Leonardo, who had
been in the beginning somewhat arid, grew delicate and allowed a mysterious
sphinx-like smile to play round the lips of his women. Manifestly he has
studied Prudhon and had much intercourse with Henner in those years when
the latter, after his return from Italy, directed attention once more to the
old Lombards. From the time when he made his début in 1879, with the
portrait of his sons, he received great encouragement, and stands out in these
days as the most mature painter of women that the present age has to
show. Only the great English portrait painters Watts and Millais, who
are inferior to him in technique, have excelled him in the embodiment of
personalities.</p>

<p>As the most skilful painter of drapery, the most brilliant decorator of
feminine beauty, <i>Carolus Duran</i> was long celebrated. The studies which he
had made in Italy had not caused him to forget that he took his origin from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page424" id="page424"></a>424</span>
across the Flemish border; and when he appeared with his first portraits,
in the beginning of the seventies, it was believed that an eminent colourist
had been born to French painting. At that time he had a fine feeling for the
eternal feminine and its transitory phases of expression, and he was as dexterous
in seizing a fleeting gesture or a turn of the head as he was in the management
of drapery and the play of its hues. Then, again, he made a gradual
transition from delicate and discreetly coquettish works to the crude arts of
upholstery. Yet even in his last period he has painted some masculine portraits&mdash;those
of Pasteur, and of the painters Français, Fritz Thaulow, and René
Billotte&mdash;which are striking in their vigorous simplicity and unforced characterisation
after the glaring virtuosity of his pictures of women.</p>

<p><i>Léon Bonnat</i>, the pupil of Madrazos, brought about the fruitful connection
between French painting and that of the old Spaniards. By this a large
quantity of the fresh blood of naturalism was poured into it once more. Born
in the South of France and educated in Spain, he had conceived there a special
enthusiasm for Ribera, and these youthful impressions were so powerful that
he remained faithful to them in Paris. As early as his residence in Italy,
which included the three years from 1858 to 1860, his individuality had been
fortified in a degree which prevented him from wasting himself on large academical
compositions like the holders of
the <i>Prix de Rome</i>; on the contrary,
he painted scenes from the varied
life of the Roman people. Several
religious pictures, such as &ldquo;The
Martyrdom of Saint Andrew&rdquo; (1863),
&ldquo;Saint Vincent de Paul&rdquo; (1866), and
the &ldquo;Job&rdquo; of the Luxembourg,
showed that he was steadily progressing
on the road paved by Spagnoletto.
He had a virtuosity in
conjuring on to the canvas visages
furrowed by the injustices of life&mdash;grey
hair, waving grey beards, and
the starting sinews and muscles of
old weather-beaten frames. In the
beginning of the seventies, when he
had to paint a Crucifixion for the
jury-chamber in the Paris Palais de
Justice, he executed a virile figure,
the muscles and anatomy of which
were as clearly marked as the buttresses
in a Gothic cathedral. As in
the paintings of Caravaggio, a sharp,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page425" id="page425"></a>425</span>
glaring light fell upon certain parts of the
body, whilst others remained dark and
colourless in the gloomy background. He
applied the same principles to his portraits.
A French Lenbach, he painted in France
a gallery of celebrated men. With an
almost tangible reality he painted Hugo,
Madame Pasta, Dumas, Gounod, Thiers,
Grévy, Pasteur, Puvis de Chavannes,
Jules Ferry, Carnot, Cardinal Lavigerie,
and others. Over two hundred persons,
famous or not, have sat to him, and he
has painted them with an exceedingly
intelligent power, masculine taste, and a
learning which never loses itself in unnecessary
detail.</p>

<p>The delicate physiognomy of women,
the <i>frou-frou</i> of exquisite toilettes, the
dreaminess, the fragrance, the coquetry of the modern Sphinx, were no
concern of his. On the other hand, his masculine portraits will always keep
their interest, if only on historical grounds. In all of them he laid great stress
on characteristic accessories, and could indicate in the simplest way the
thinker, the musician, the scholar, and the statesman. One remembers his
pictures as though they were phrases uttered with conviction, though a German
does not hesitate to place Lenbach far above Bonnat as a psychologist. The
latter has not the power of seizing the momentary effect, the intimacy, the
personal note, the palpitating life peculiar to Lenbach. With the intention
of saying all things he often forgets the most important&mdash;the spirit of the
man and the grace of the woman. His pictures are great pieces of still-life&mdash;exceedingly
conscientious, but having something of the conscientiousness
of an actuary copying a tedious protocol. The portrait of Léon Cogniet,
the teacher of the master, with his aged face, his spectacled eyes, and his
puckered hands (Musée Luxembourg), is perhaps the only likeness in which
Bonnat rivals Lenbach in depth of characterisation. His pictorial strength
is always worthy of respect; but, for the sake of variety, the <i>esprit</i> is for once
on the side of the German.</p>

<p>Ruled by a passion for the Spanish masters, such as Bonnat possessed,
<i>Roybet</i> painted cavaliers of the seventeenth century, and other historical
pictures of manners, which are distinguished, to their advantage, from older
pictures of their type, because it is not the historical anecdote but the pictorial
idea which is their basis. All the earlier painters were rather bent upon
archæological accuracy than on pictorial charm in the treatment of such
themes. Roybet revelled in the rich hues of old costumes, and sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page426" id="page426"></a>426</span>
attained, before he strained
his talent in the Procrustean
bed of pictures of great size,
a bloom and a strong, glowing
tone which rival the old
masters.</p>

<p>In all periods which have
learnt to see the world
through a pictorial medium,
still-life has held an important
place in the practice of
art. A technical instinct,
which is in itself art, delights
in investing musical instruments,
golden and silver
vessels, fruit and other eatables,
glasses and goblets,
coverings of precious work,
gauntlets and armour, all
imaginable <i>petit-riens</i>, with
an artistic magic, in recognising
and executing pictorial
problems everywhere. After
the transition from historical and <i>genre</i> painting had been made to painting
proper there once more appeared great painters of still-life in France as there
did in Chardin&rsquo;s days.</p>

<p>Yet <i>Blaise Desgoffe</i>, who painted piecemeal and with laborious patience
goldsmith&rsquo;s work, crystal vases, Venetian glass, and such things, is certainly
rather petty. In France he was the chief representative of that precise and
detailed painting which understands by art a deceptive imitation of objects,
and sees its end attained when the holiday public gathers round the pictures
as the birds gathered round the grapes of Zeuxis.</p>

<p>It is as if an old master had revived in <i>Philippe Rousseau</i>. He had the
same earnest qualities as the Dutch and Flemish Classic masters&mdash;a broad,
liquid, pasty method of execution, a fine harmony of clear and powerful tones&mdash;and
with all this a marvellous address in so composing objects that no
trace of &ldquo;composition&rdquo; is discernible. His work arose from the animal
picture. His painting of dogs and cats is to be ranked with the best of the
century. He makes a fourth with Gillot, Chardin, and Decamps, the great
painters of monkeys. As a decorator of genius, like Hondekoeter, he embellished
a whole series of dining-halls with splendidly coloured representations
of poultry, and, like Snyders, he heaped together game, dead and living
fowl, fruit, lobsters, and oysters into huge life-size masses of still-life. Behind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page427" id="page427"></a>427</span>
them the cook may be seen, and thievish cats steal around. But, like
Kalf, he has also painted, with an exquisite feeling for colour, Japanese
porcelain bowls with bunches of grapes, quinces, and apricots, metal and
ivory work, helmets and fiddles, against that delicate grey-brown-green tone
of background which Chardin loved.</p>

<p><i>Antoine Vollon</i> became the greatest painter of still-life in the century.
Indeed, Vollon is as broad and nervous as Desgoffe is precise and pedantic.
Flowers, fruit, and fish&mdash;they are all painted in with a firm hand, and shine
out of the dark background with a full liquid freshness of colour. He
paints dead salt-water fish like Abraham van Beyeren, grapes and crystal
goblets like Davids de Heem, dead game like Frans Snyders, skinned
pigs like Rembrandt and Maes. He is a master in the representation
of freshly gathered flowers, delicate vegetables, copper kettles, weapons,
and suits of armour. Since Chardin no painter depicted the qualities of
the skin of fresh fruit, its life and its play of colour, and the moist bloom
that rests upon it, with such fidelity to nature. His fish in particular
will always remain the wonder of all painters and connoisseurs. But
landscapes, Dutch canal views, and figure-pictures are also to be found
amongst his works. He has
painted everything that is picturesque,
and the history of art
must do him honour as, in a
specifically pictorial sense, one
of the greatest in the century.
A soft grey-brown wainscoting,
a black and white Pierrot costume,
and a white table-cloth
and dark green vegetables&mdash;such
is the harmony of colour which
he chiefly loved in his figure-pictures.</p>

<p>On the same purely pictorial
grounds nuns became very popular
in painting, as their white
hoods and collars standing out
against a black dress gave the
opportunity for such a fine effect
of tone. This was the province
in which poor <i>François Bonvin</i>
laboured. Deriving from the
Dutch, he conceived an enthusiasm
for work, silence, the subdued
shining of light in interiors,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page428" id="page428"></a>428</span>
cold days, the slow movements
and peaceful faces of nuns, and
painted kitchen scenes with a
strong personal accent. Before
he took up painting he was for a
long time a policeman, and was
employed in taking charge of the
markets. Here he acquired an
eye for the picturesqueness of
juicy vegetables, white collars,
and white hoods, and when he
had a day free he studied Lenain
and Chardin in the Louvre. Bonvin&rsquo;s
pictures have no anecdotic
purport. Drinkers, cooks, orphan
children in the schoolroom,
sempstresses, choristers, sisters
of mercy, boys reading, women
in church, nuns conducting a
sewing-class&mdash;Bonvin&rsquo;s still, picturesque,
congenial world is made
up of elements such as these.
What his people may think or
do is no matter: they are only
meant to create an effect as
pictorial tones in space. During
his journey to Holland he had examined Metsu, Frans Hals, Pieter de
Hoogh, Terborg, and Van der Meer with an understanding for their merits,
but it was Chardin in both his phases&mdash;as painter of still-life and of familiar
events&mdash;who was in a special sense revived in Bonvin. All his pictures
are simple and quiet; his figures are peaceful in their expression, and have
an easy geniality of pose; his hues have a beauty and fulness of tone recalling
the old masters.</p>

<p>Even <i>Théodule Ribot</i>, the most eminent of the group, one of the most
dexterous executants of the French school, a master who for power of expression
is worthy of being placed between Frans Hals and Ribera, made a
beginning with still-life. He was born in 1823, in a little town of the department
of Eure. Early married and poor, he supported himself at first by
painting frames for a firm of mirror manufacturers, and only reserved the
hours of the evening for his artistic labours. In particular he is said to have
accustomed himself to work whole nights through by lamplight, while he
nursed his wife during a long illness, watching at her bedside. The lamplight
intensified the contrasts of light and shadow. Thus Ribot&rsquo;s preference for
concentrated light and strong shadows is partially due, in all probability, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page429" id="page429"></a>429</span>
what he had gone through in his life, and in later days Ribera merely bestowed
upon him a benediction as his predecessor in the history of art.</p>

<p>His first pictures from the years 1861 to 1865 were, for the most part,
scenes from household and kitchen life: cooks, as large as life, plucking poultry,
setting meat before the fire, scouring vessels, or tasting sauces; sometimes,
also, figures in the streets; but even here there was a strong accentuation of
the element of still-life. There were men with cooking utensils, food, dead
birds, and fish. Then after 1865 there followed a number of religious pictures
which, in their hard, peasant-like veracity and their impressive, concentrated
life, stood in the most abrupt contrast with the conventionally idealised
figures of the academicians. His &ldquo;Jesus in the Temple,&rdquo; no less than &ldquo;Saint
Sebastian&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Good Samaritan&rdquo;&mdash;all three in the Musée Luxembourg&mdash;are
works of simple and forceful grandeur, and have a thrilling effect which
almost excites dismay. Sebastian is no smiling saint gracefully embellished
with wounds, but a suffering man, with the blood streaming from his veins,
stretched upon the earth; yet half-raising himself, a cry of agony upon his
lips, and his whole body contorted by spasms of pain. In his &ldquo;Jesus in the
Temple,&rdquo; going on parallel lines with Menzel, he proclaims the doctrine that
it is only possible to pour new life-blood into traditional figures by a tactful
choice of models from popular life around. And in &ldquo;The Good Samaritan,&rdquo;
also, he was only concerned
to paint, with naturalistic
force, the body of a wounded
man lying in the street, a
thick-set French peasant
robbed of his clothes. From
the seventies his specialty
was heads&mdash;separate figures
of weather-beaten old folk,
old women knitting or writing,
old men reading or lost
in thought; and these will
always be ranked with the
greatest masterpieces of the
century. Ribot attains a
remarkable effect when he
paints those expressive faces
of his, which seem to follow
you with their looks, and
are thrown out from the
darkness of his canvas. A
black background, in which
the dark dresses of his figures
are insensibly lost, a luminous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page430" id="page430"></a>430</span>
head with such eyes as no one of the century has ever painted, wrinkled
skin and puckered old hands rising from somewhere&mdash;one knows not whence&mdash;these
are things which all lend his figures something phantasmal, superhuman,
and ghostly. Ribot is the great king of the under-world, to which
a sunbeam only penetrates by stealth. Before his pictures one has the sense
of wandering in a deep, deep shaft of some mine, where all is dark and
only now and then a lantern glimmers. No artist, not even Ribera, has been
a better painter of old people, and only Velasquez has painted children who
have such sparkling life. Ribot worked in Colombes, near Paris, to which
place he had early withdrawn, in a barn where only tiny dormer-windows let
in two sharp rays of light.</p>

<p>By placing his canvas beneath one window and his model beneath the
other, in a dim light which allowed only one golden ray to fall upon the face,
he isolated it completely from its surroundings, and in this way painted the
parts illuminated with the more astonishing effect. No one had the same
power in modelling a forehead, indicating the bones beneath the flesh, and
rendering all the subtleties of skin. A terrible and intense life is in his figures.
His old beggars and sailors especially have something kingly in the grand
style of their noble and quiet faces. An old master with a powerful technique,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page431" id="page431"></a>431</span>
a painter of the force and health of Jordaens, has manifested himself once
more in Ribot.</p>

<p>Courbet&rsquo;s principles, accordingly, had won all down the line, in the course
of a few years. &ldquo;It is only Ribera, Zurbaran, and Velasquez that I admire;
Ostade and Craesbeeck also allure me; and for Holbein I feel veneration. As
for M. Raphael, there is no doubt that he has painted some interesting portraits,
but I cannot find any ideas in him.&rdquo; In these words he had prophesied as
early as 1855 the course which French art would take in the next decade.
When Courbet appeared the grand painting stood in thraldom to the <i>beauté
suprême</i>, and the æsthetic conceptions of the time affected the treatment of
contemporary subjects. Artists had not realism enough to give truth and
animation to these themes. When Cabanel, Hamon, and Bouguereau occasionally
painted beggars and orphans, they were bloodless phantoms, because
by beautifying the figures they deprived them of character in the effort to give
them, approximately, the forms of historical painting. Because painters did
not regard their own epoch, because they had been accustomed to consider
living beings merely as elements of the second and third rank, they never
discovered the distinctiveness of their essential life. Like a traveller possessed
by one fixed mania, they made a voyage round the world, thinking only how
they might adapt living forms to those which their traditional training recommended
as peculiarly right and alone worthy of art. Even portrait painting
was dominated by this false
method, of rendering figures
as types, of improving the
features and the contour of
bodies, and giving men the
external appearance of fair,
ideal figures.</p>

<p>But now the sway of the
Cinquecento has been finally
broken. A fresh breeze of
realism from across the Pyrenees
has taken the place of
the sultry Italian sirocco.
From the pictures of the Neapolitans, the
Spaniards, and the
Dutch it has been learnt that
the joys and sorrows of the
people are just as capable of
representation as the actions
of gods and heroes, and under
the influence of these views a
complete change in the cast
has taken place.</p>

<p>The figures which in 1855 filled Courbet&rsquo;s picture &ldquo;The Studio&rdquo;&mdash;beggar-women,
agricultural labourers, artisans, sailors, tippling soldiers, buxom girls,
porters, rough members of the proletariat of uncouth stature&mdash;now crowd
the stage of French art, and impart even to the heroes of history, bred through
centuries from degenerated gods, something of their full-blooded, rough,
hearty, and plebeian force of life. The artists of Italian taste only gave the
rights of citizenship to &ldquo;universal forms&rdquo;; every reminiscence of national
customs or of local character was counted vulgar; they did not discover the
gold of beauty in the rich mines of popular life, but in the classic masters of
foreign race. But now even what is unearthly is translated into the terms
of earth. If religious pictures are to be painted, artists take men from the
people for their model, as Caravaggio did before them&mdash;poor old peasants
with bones of iron, and bronzed, weather-beaten faces, porters with figures
bowed and scarred by labour, men of rough, common nature, though of
gnarled and sinewy muscles. The pictures of martyrs, once artificial compositions
of beautiful gesture and vacant, generalised countenances, receive a
tone local to the scaffold, a trait of merciless veracity&mdash;the heads the energy
of a relief, the gestures force and impressiveness, the bodies a science in their
modelling which would have rejoiced Ribera. As Caravaggio said that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page433" id="page433"></a>433</span>
more wrinkles his model had the more he liked him, so no one is any longer
repelled by horny hands, tattered rags, and dirty feet. In the good periods
of art it is well known that the beauty or uncomeliness of a work has nothing
to do with the beauty or uncomeliness of the model, and that the most hideous
cripple can afford an opportunity for making the most beautiful work. The
old doctrine of Leonardo, that every kind of painting is portrait painting,
and that the best artists are those who can imitate nature in the most convincing
way, comes once more into operation. The apotheosis of the model
has taken the place of idealism. And during these same years England
reached a similar goal by another route.</p>
